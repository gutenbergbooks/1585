    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing like a little judicious levity,&rsquo; says Michael Finsbury in the
      text: nor can any better excuse be found for the volume in the reader&rsquo;s
      hand. The authors can but add that one of them is old enough to be ashamed
      of himself, and the other young enough to learn better.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. In Which Morris Suspects
    </h2>
    <p>
      How very little does the amateur, dwelling at home at ease, comprehend the
      labours and perils of the author, and, when he smilingly skims the surface
      of a work of fiction, how little does he consider the hours of toil,
      consultation of authorities, researches in the Bodleian, correspondence
      with learned and illegible Germans&mdash;in one word, the vast scaffolding
      that was first built up and then knocked down, to while away an hour for
      him in a railway train! Thus I might begin this tale with a biography of
      Tonti&mdash;birthplace, parentage, genius probably inherited from his
      mother, remarkable instance of precocity, etc&mdash;and a complete
      treatise on the system to which he bequeathed his name. The material is
      all beside me in a pigeon-hole, but I scorn to appear vainglorious. Tonti
      is dead, and I never saw anyone who even pretended to regret him; and, as
      for the tontine system, a word will suffice for all the purposes of this
      unvarnished narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of sprightly youths (the more the merrier) put up a certain sum
      of money, which is then funded in a pool under trustees; coming on for a
      century later, the proceeds are fluttered for a moment in the face of the
      last survivor, who is probably deaf, so that he cannot even hear of his
      success&mdash;and who is certainly dying, so that he might just as well
      have lost. The peculiar poetry and even humour of the scheme is now
      apparent, since it is one by which nobody concerned can possibly profit;
      but its fine, sportsmanlike character endeared it to our grandparents.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Joseph Finsbury and his brother Masterman were little lads in
      white-frilled trousers, their father&mdash;a well-to-do merchant in
      Cheapside&mdash;caused them to join a small but rich tontine of
      seven-and-thirty lives. A thousand pounds was the entrance fee; and Joseph
      Finsbury can remember to this day the visit to the lawyer&rsquo;s, where the
      members of the tontine&mdash;all children like himself&mdash;were
      assembled together, and sat in turn in the big office chair, and signed
      their names with the assistance of a kind old gentleman in spectacles and
      Wellington boots. He remembers playing with the children afterwards on the
      lawn at the back of the lawyer&rsquo;s house, and a battle-royal that he had
      with a brother tontiner who had kicked his shins. The sound of war called
      forth the lawyer from where he was dispensing cake and wine to the
      assembled parents in the office, and the combatants were separated, and
      Joseph&rsquo;s spirit (for he was the smaller of the two) commended by the
      gentleman in the Wellington boots, who vowed he had been just such another
      at the same age. Joseph wondered to himself if he had worn at that time
      little Wellingtons and a little bald head, and when, in bed at night, he
      grew tired of telling himself stories of sea-fights, he used to dress
      himself up as the old gentleman, and entertain other little boys and girls
      with cake and wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1840 the thirty-seven were all alive; in 1850 their number had
      decreased by six; in 1856 and 1857 business was more lively, for the
      Crimea and the Mutiny carried off no less than nine. There remained in
      1870 but five of the original members, and at the date of my story,
      including the two Finsburys, but three.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Masterman was in his seventy-third year; he had long
      complained of the effects of age, had long since retired from business,
      and now lived in absolute seclusion under the roof of his son Michael, the
      well-known solicitor. Joseph, on the other hand, was still up and about,
      and still presented but a semi-venerable figure on the streets in which he
      loved to wander. This was the more to be deplored because Masterman had
      led (even to the least particular) a model British life. Industry,
      regularity, respectability, and a preference for the four per cents are
      understood to be the very foundations of a green old age. All these
      Masterman had eminently displayed, and here he was, ab agendo, at
      seventy-three; while Joseph, barely two years younger, and in the most
      excellent preservation, had disgraced himself through life by idleness and
      eccentricity. Embarked in the leather trade, he had early wearied of
      business, for which he was supposed to have small parts. A taste for
      general information, not promptly checked, had soon begun to sap his
      manhood. There is no passion more debilitating to the mind, unless,
      perhaps, it be that itch of public speaking which it not infrequently
      accompanies or begets. The two were conjoined in the case of Joseph; the
      acute stage of this double malady, that in which the patient delivers
      gratuitous lectures, soon declared itself with severity, and not many
      years had passed over his head before he would have travelled thirty miles
      to address an infant school. He was no student; his reading was confined
      to elementary textbooks and the daily papers; he did not even fly as high
      as cyclopedias; life, he would say, was his volume. His lectures were not
      meant, he would declare, for college professors; they were addressed
      direct to &lsquo;the great heart of the people&rsquo;, and the heart of the people
      must certainly be sounder than its head, for his lucubrations were
      received with favour. That entitled &lsquo;How to Live Cheerfully on Forty
      Pounds a Year&rsquo;, created a sensation among the unemployed. &lsquo;Education: Its
      Aims, Objects, Purposes, and Desirability&rsquo;, gained him the respect of the
      shallow-minded. As for his celebrated essay on &lsquo;Life Insurance Regarded in
      its Relation to the Masses&rsquo;, read before the Working Men&rsquo;s Mutual
      Improvement Society, Isle of Dogs, it was received with a &lsquo;literal
      ovation&rsquo; by an unintelligent audience of both sexes, and so marked was the
      effect that he was next year elected honorary president of the
      institution, an office of less than no emolument&mdash;since the holder
      was expected to come down with a donation&mdash;but one which highly
      satisfied his self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Joseph was thus building himself up a reputation among the more
      cultivated portion of the ignorant, his domestic life was suddenly
      overwhelmed by orphans. The death of his younger brother Jacob saddled him
      with the charge of two boys, Morris and John; and in the course of the
      same year his family was still further swelled by the addition of a little
      girl, the daughter of John Henry Hazeltine, Esq., a gentleman of small
      property and fewer friends. He had met Joseph only once, at a lecture-hall
      in Holloway; but from that formative experience he returned home to make a
      new will, and consign his daughter and her fortune to the lecturer. Joseph
      had a kindly disposition; and yet it was not without reluctance that he
      accepted this new responsibility, advertised for a nurse, and purchased a
      second-hand perambulator. Morris and John he made more readily welcome;
      not so much because of the tie of consanguinity as because the leather
      business (in which he hastened to invest their fortune of thirty thousand
      pounds) had recently exhibited inexplicable symptoms of decline. A young
      but capable Scot was chosen as manager to the enterprise, and the cares of
      business never again afflicted Joseph Finsbury. Leaving his charges in the
      hands of the capable Scot (who was married), he began his extensive
      travels on the Continent and in Asia Minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a polyglot Testament in one hand and a phrase-book in the other, he
      groped his way among the speakers of eleven European languages. The first
      of these guides is hardly applicable to the purposes of the philosophic
      traveller, and even the second is designed more expressly for the tourist
      than for the expert in life. But he pressed interpreters into his service&mdash;whenever
      he could get their services for nothing&mdash;and by one means and another
      filled many notebooks with the results of his researches.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these wanderings he spent several years, and only returned to England
      when the increasing age of his charges needed his attention. The two lads
      had been placed in a good but economical school, where they had received a
      sound commercial education; which was somewhat awkward, as the leather
      business was by no means in a state to court enquiry. In fact, when Joseph
      went over his accounts preparatory to surrendering his trust, he was
      dismayed to discover that his brother&rsquo;s fortune had not increased by his
      stewardship; even by making over to his two wards every penny he had in
      the world, there would still be a deficit of seven thousand eight hundred
      pounds. When these facts were communicated to the two brothers in the
      presence of a lawyer, Morris Finsbury threatened his uncle with all the
      terrors of the law, and was only prevented from taking extreme steps by
      the advice of the professional man. &lsquo;You cannot get blood from a stone,&rsquo; 
      observed the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Morris saw the point and came to terms with his uncle. On the one
      side, Joseph gave up all that he possessed, and assigned to his nephew his
      contingent interest in the tontine, already quite a hopeful speculation.
      On the other, Morris agreed to harbour his uncle and Miss Hazeltine (who
      had come to grief with the rest), and to pay to each of them one pound a
      month as pocket-money. The allowance was amply sufficient for the old man;
      it scarce appears how Miss Hazeltine contrived to dress upon it; but she
      did, and, what is more, she never complained. She was, indeed, sincerely
      attached to her incompetent guardian. He had never been unkind; his age
      spoke for him loudly; there was something appealing in his whole-souled
      quest of knowledge and innocent delight in the smallest mark of
      admiration; and, though the lawyer had warned her she was being
      sacrificed, Julia had refused to add to the perplexities of Uncle Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a large, dreary house in John Street, Bloomsbury, these four dwelt
      together; a family in appearance, in reality a financial association.
      Julia and Uncle Joseph were, of course, slaves; John, a gentle man with a
      taste for the banjo, the music-hall, the Gaiety bar, and the sporting
      papers, must have been anywhere a secondary figure; and the cares and
      delights of empire devolved entirely upon Morris. That these are
      inextricably intermixed is one of the commonplaces with which the bland
      essayist consoles the incompetent and the obscure, but in the case of
      Morris the bitter must have largely outweighed the sweet. He grudged no
      trouble to himself, he spared none to others; he called the servants in
      the morning, he served out the stores with his own hand, he took soundings
      of the sherry, he numbered the remainder biscuits; painful scenes took
      place over the weekly bills, and the cook was frequently impeached, and
      the tradespeople came and hectored with him in the back parlour upon a
      question of three farthings. The superficial might have deemed him a
      miser; in his own eyes he was simply a man who had been defrauded; the
      world owed him seven thousand eight hundred pounds, and he intended that
      the world should pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was in his dealings with Joseph that Morris&rsquo;s character
      particularly shone. His uncle was a rather gambling stock in which he had
      invested heavily; and he spared no pains in nursing the security. The old
      man was seen monthly by a physician, whether he was well or ill. His diet,
      his raiment, his occasional outings, now to Brighton, now to Bournemouth,
      were doled out to him like pap to infants. In bad weather he must keep the
      house. In good weather, by half-past nine, he must be ready in the hall;
      Morris would see that he had gloves and that his shoes were sound; and the
      pair would start for the leather business arm in arm. The way there was
      probably dreary enough, for there was no pretence of friendly feeling;
      Morris had never ceased to upbraid his guardian with his defalcation and
      to lament the burthen of Miss Hazeltine; and Joseph, though he was a mild
      enough soul, regarded his nephew with something very near akin to hatred.
      But the way there was nothing to the journey back; for the mere sight of
      the place of business, as well as every detail of its transactions, was
      enough to poison life for any Finsbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph&rsquo;s name was still over the door; it was he who still signed the
      cheques; but this was only policy on the part of Morris, and designed to
      discourage other members of the tontine. In reality the business was
      entirely his; and he found it an inheritance of sorrows. He tried to sell
      it, and the offers he received were quite derisory. He tried to extend it,
      and it was only the liabilities he succeeded in extending; to restrict it,
      and it was only the profits he managed to restrict. Nobody had ever made
      money out of that concern except the capable Scot, who retired (after his
      discharge) to the neighbourhood of Banff and built a castle with his
      profits. The memory of this fallacious Caledonian Morris would revile
      daily, as he sat in the private office opening his mail, with old Joseph
      at another table, sullenly awaiting orders, or savagely affixing
      signatures to he knew not what. And when the man of the heather pushed
      cynicism so far as to send him the announcement of his second marriage (to
      Davida, eldest daughter of the Revd. Alexander McCraw), it was really
      supposed that Morris would have had a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business hours, in the Finsbury leather trade, had been cut to the quick;
      even Morris&rsquo;s strong sense of duty to himself was not strong enough to
      dally within those walls and under the shadow of that bankruptcy; and
      presently the manager and the clerks would draw a long breath, and compose
      themselves for another day of procrastination. Raw Haste, on the authority
      of my Lord Tennyson, is half-sister to Delay; but the Business Habits are
      certainly her uncles. Meanwhile, the leather merchant would lead his
      living investment back to John Street like a puppy dog; and, having there
      immured him in the hall, would depart for the day on the quest of seal
      rings, the only passion of his life. Joseph had more than the vanity of
      man, he had that of lecturers. He owned he was in fault, although more
      sinned against (by the capable Scot) than sinning; but had he steeped his
      hands in gore, he would still not deserve to be thus dragged at the
      chariot-wheels of a young man, to sit a captive in the halls of his own
      leather business, to be entertained with mortifying comments on his whole
      career&mdash;to have his costume examined, his collar pulled up, the
      presence of his mittens verified, and to be taken out and brought home in
      custody, like an infant with a nurse. At the thought of it his soul would
      swell with venom, and he would make haste to hang up his hat and coat and
      the detested mittens, and slink upstairs to Julia and his notebooks. The
      drawing-room at least was sacred from Morris; it belonged to the old man
      and the young girl; it was there that she made her dresses; it was there
      that he inked his spectacles over the registration of disconnected facts
      and the calculation of insignificant statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he would sometimes lament his connection with the tontine. &lsquo;If it
      were not for that,&rsquo; he cried one afternoon, &lsquo;he would not care to keep me.
      I might be a free man, Julia. And I could so easily support myself by
      giving lectures.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure you could,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;and I think it one of the meanest
      things he ever did to deprive you of that amusement. There were those nice
      people at the Isle of Cats (wasn&rsquo;t it?) who wrote and asked you so very
      kindly to give them an address. I did think he might have let you go to
      the Isle of Cats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a man of no intelligence,&rsquo; cried Joseph. &lsquo;He lives here literally
      surrounded by the absorbing spectacle of life, and for all the good it
      does him, he might just as well be in his coffin. Think of his
      opportunities! The heart of any other young man would burn within him at
      the chance. The amount of information that I have it in my power to
      convey, if he would only listen, is a thing that beggars language, Julia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever you do, my dear, you mustn&rsquo;t excite yourself,&rsquo; said Julia; &lsquo;for
      you know, if you look at all ill, the doctor will be sent for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is very true,&rsquo; returned the old man humbly, &lsquo;I will compose myself
      with a little study.&rsquo; He thumbed his gallery of notebooks. &lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;I wonder (since I see your hands are occupied) whether it might not
      interest you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, of course it would,&rsquo; cried Julia. &lsquo;Read me one of your nice stories,
      there&rsquo;s a dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the volume down and his spectacles upon his nose instanter, as
      though to forestall some possible retractation. &lsquo;What I propose to read to
      you,&rsquo; said he, skimming through the pages, &lsquo;is the notes of a highly
      important conversation with a Dutch courier of the name of David Abbas,
      which is the Latin for abbot. Its results are well worth the money it cost
      me, for, as Abbas at first appeared somewhat impatient, I was induced to
      (what is, I believe, singularly called) stand him drink. It runs only to
      about five-and-twenty pages. Yes, here it is.&rsquo; He cleared his throat, and
      began to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Finsbury (according to his own report) contributed about four hundred
      and ninety-nine five-hundredths of the interview, and elicited from Abbas
      literally nothing. It was dull for Julia, who did not require to listen;
      for the Dutch courier, who had to answer, it must have been a perfect
      nightmare. It would seem as if he had consoled himself by frequent
      appliances to the bottle; it would even seem that (toward the end) he had
      ceased to depend on Joseph&rsquo;s frugal generosity and called for the flagon
      on his own account. The effect, at least, of some mellowing influence was
      visible in the record: Abbas became suddenly a willing witness; he began
      to volunteer disclosures; and Julia had just looked up from her seam with
      something like a smile, when Morris burst into the house, eagerly calling
      for his uncle, and the next instant plunged into the room, waving in the
      air the evening paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed with great news that he came charged. The demise was
      announced of Lieutenant-General Sir Glasgow Biggar, KCSI, KCMG, etc., and
      the prize of the tontine now lay between the Finsbury brothers. Here was
      Morris&rsquo;s opportunity at last. The brothers had never, it is true, been
      cordial. When word came that Joseph was in Asia Minor, Masterman had
      expressed himself with irritation. &lsquo;I call it simply indecent,&rsquo; he had
      said. &lsquo;Mark my words&mdash;we shall hear of him next at the North Pole.&rsquo; 
      And these bitter expressions had been reported to the traveller on his
      return. What was worse, Masterman had refused to attend the lecture on
      &lsquo;Education: Its Aims, Objects, Purposes, and Desirability&rsquo;, although
      invited to the platform. Since then the brothers had not met. On the other
      hand, they never had openly quarrelled; Joseph (by Morris&rsquo;s orders) was
      prepared to waive the advantage of his juniority; Masterman had enjoyed
      all through life the reputation of a man neither greedy nor unfair. Here,
      then, were all the elements of compromise assembled; and Morris, suddenly
      beholding his seven thousand eight hundred pounds restored to him, and
      himself dismissed from the vicissitudes of the leather trade, hastened the
      next morning to the office of his cousin Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael was something of a public character. Launched upon the law at a
      very early age, and quite without protectors, he had become a trafficker
      in shady affairs. He was known to be the man for a lost cause; it was
      known he could extract testimony from a stone, and interest from a
      gold-mine; and his office was besieged in consequence by all that numerous
      class of persons who have still some reputation to lose, and find
      themselves upon the point of losing it; by those who have made undesirable
      acquaintances, who have mislaid a compromising correspondence, or who are
      blackmailed by their own butlers. In private life Michael was a man of
      pleasure; but it was thought his dire experience at the office had gone
      far to sober him, and it was known that (in the matter of investments) he
      preferred the solid to the brilliant. What was yet more to the purpose, he
      had been all his life a consistent scoffer at the Finsbury tontine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was therefore with little fear for the result that Morris presented
      himself before his cousin, and proceeded feverishly to set forth his
      scheme. For near upon a quarter of an hour the lawyer suffered him to
      dwell upon its manifest advantages uninterrupted. Then Michael rose from
      his seat, and, ringing for his clerk, uttered a single clause: &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t
      do, Morris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in vain that the leather merchant pleaded and reasoned, and
      returned day after day to plead and reason. It was in vain that he offered
      a bonus of one thousand, of two thousand, of three thousand pounds; in
      vain that he offered, in Joseph&rsquo;s name, to be content with only one-third
      of the pool. Still there came the same answer: &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see the bottom of this,&rsquo; he said at last. &lsquo;You answer none of my
      arguments; you haven&rsquo;t a word to say. For my part, I believe it&rsquo;s malice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer smiled at him benignly. &lsquo;You may believe one thing,&rsquo; said he.
      &lsquo;Whatever else I do, I am not going to gratify any of your curiosity. You
      see I am a trifle more communicative today, because this is our last
      interview upon the subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our last interview!&rsquo; cried Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The stirrup-cup, dear boy,&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t have my business
      hours encroached upon. And, by the by, have you no business of your own?
      Are there no convulsions in the leather trade?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe it to be malice,&rsquo; repeated Morris doggedly. &lsquo;You always hated
      and despised me from a boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no&mdash;not hated,&rsquo; returned Michael soothingly. &lsquo;I rather like you
      than otherwise; there&rsquo;s such a permanent surprise about you, you look so
      dark and attractive from a distance. Do you know that to the naked eye you
      look romantic?&mdash;like what they call a man with a history? And indeed,
      from all that I can hear, the history of the leather trade is full of
      incident.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Morris, disregarding these remarks, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no use coming here.
      I shall see your father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no, you won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;Nobody shall see my father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to know why,&rsquo; cried his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never make any secret of that,&rsquo; replied the lawyer. &lsquo;He is too ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he is as ill as you say,&rsquo; cried the other, &lsquo;the more reason for
      accepting my proposal. I will see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you?&rsquo; said Michael, and he rose and rang for his clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now time, according to Sir Faraday Bond, the medical baronet whose
      name is so familiar at the foot of bulletins, that Joseph (the poor Golden
      Goose) should be removed into the purer air of Bournemouth; and for that
      uncharted wilderness of villas the family now shook off the dust of
      Bloomsbury; Julia delighted, because at Bournemouth she sometimes made
      acquaintances; John in despair, for he was a man of city tastes; Joseph
      indifferent where he was, so long as there was pen and ink and daily
      papers, and he could avoid martyrdom at the office; Morris himself,
      perhaps, not displeased to pretermit these visits to the city, and have a
      quiet time for thought. He was prepared for any sacrifice; all he desired
      was to get his money again and clear his feet of leather; and it would be
      strange, since he was so modest in his desires, and the pool amounted to
      upward of a hundred and sixteen thousand pounds&mdash;it would be strange
      indeed if he could find no way of influencing Michael. &lsquo;If I could only
      guess his reason,&rsquo; he repeated to himself; and by day, as he walked in
      Branksome Woods, and by night, as he turned upon his bed, and at
      meal-times, when he forgot to eat, and in the bathing machine, when he
      forgot to dress himself, that problem was constantly before him: Why had
      Michael refused?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one night, he burst into his brother&rsquo;s room and woke him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rsquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Julia leaves this place tomorrow,&rsquo; replied Morris. &lsquo;She must go up to
      town and get the house ready, and find servants. We shall all follow in
      three days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, brayvo!&rsquo; cried John. &lsquo;But why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found it out, John,&rsquo; returned his brother gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It? What?&rsquo; enquired John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why Michael won&rsquo;t compromise,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s because he can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s
      because Masterman&rsquo;s dead, and he&rsquo;s keeping it dark.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Golly!&rsquo; cried the impressionable John. &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s the use? Why does he
      do it, anyway?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To defraud us of the tontine,&rsquo; said his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t; you have to have a doctor&rsquo;s certificate,&rsquo; objected John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you never hear of venal doctors?&rsquo; enquired Morris. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re as common
      as blackberries: you can pick &lsquo;em up for three-pound-ten a head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it under fifty if I were a sawbones,&rsquo; ejaculated John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then Michael,&rsquo; continued Morris, &lsquo;is in the very thick of it. All his
      clients have come to grief; his whole business is rotten eggs. If any man
      could arrange it, he could; and depend upon it, he has his plan all
      straight; and depend upon it, it&rsquo;s a good one, for he&rsquo;s clever, and be
      damned to him! But I&rsquo;m clever too; and I&rsquo;m desperate. I lost seven
      thousand eight hundred pounds when I was an orphan at school.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t be tedious,&rsquo; interrupted John. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve lost far more already
      trying to get it back.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. In Which Morris takes Action
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some days later, accordingly, the three males of this depressing family
      might have been observed (by a reader of G. P. R. James) taking their
      departure from the East Station of Bournemouth. The weather was raw and
      changeable, and Joseph was arrayed in consequence according to the
      principles of Sir Faraday Bond, a man no less strict (as is well known) on
      costume than on diet. There are few polite invalids who have not lived, or
      tried to live, by that punctilious physician&rsquo;s orders. &lsquo;Avoid tea, madam,&rsquo; 
      the reader has doubtless heard him say, &lsquo;avoid tea, fried liver,
      antimonial wine, and bakers&rsquo; bread. Retire nightly at 10.45; and clothe
      yourself (if you please) throughout in hygienic flannel. Externally, the
      fur of the marten is indicated. Do not forget to procure a pair of health
      boots at Messrs Dail and Crumbie&rsquo;s.&rsquo; And he has probably called you back,
      even after you have paid your fee, to add with stentorian emphasis: &lsquo;I had
      forgotten one caution: avoid kippered sturgeon as you would the very
      devil.&rsquo; The unfortunate Joseph was cut to the pattern of Sir Faraday in
      every button; he was shod with the health boot; his suit was of genuine
      ventilating cloth; his shirt of hygienic flannel, a somewhat dingy fabric;
      and he was draped to the knees in the inevitable greatcoat of marten&rsquo;s
      fur. The very railway porters at Bournemouth (which was a favourite
      station of the doctor&rsquo;s) marked the old gentleman for a creature of Sir
      Faraday. There was but one evidence of personal taste, a vizarded forage
      cap; from this form of headpiece, since he had fled from a dying jackal on
      the plains of Ephesus, and weathered a bora in the Adriatic, nothing could
      divorce our traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three Finsburys mounted into their compartment, and fell immediately
      to quarrelling, a step unseemly in itself and (in this case) highly
      unfortunate for Morris. Had he lingered a moment longer by the window,
      this tale need never have been written. For he might then have observed
      (as the porters did not fail to do) the arrival of a second passenger in
      the uniform of Sir Faraday Bond. But he had other matters on hand, which
      he judged (God knows how erroneously) to be more important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard of such a thing,&rsquo; he cried, resuming a discussion which had
      scarcely ceased all morning. &lsquo;The bill is not yours; it is mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is payable to me,&rsquo; returned the old gentleman, with an air of bitter
      obstinacy. &lsquo;I will do what I please with my own property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bill was one for eight hundred pounds, which had been given him at
      breakfast to endorse, and which he had simply pocketed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear him, Johnny!&rsquo; cried Morris. &lsquo;His property! the very clothes upon his
      back belong to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him alone,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;I am sick of both of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is no way to speak of your uncle, sir,&rsquo; cried Joseph. &lsquo;I will not
      endure this disrespect. You are a pair of exceedingly forward, impudent,
      and ignorant young men, and I have quite made up my mind to put an end to
      the whole business.&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O skittles!&rsquo; said the graceful John.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Morris was not so easy in his mind. This unusual act of
      insubordination had already troubled him; and these mutinous words now
      sounded ominously in his ears. He looked at the old gentleman uneasily.
      Upon one occasion, many years before, when Joseph was delivering a
      lecture, the audience had revolted in a body; finding their entertainer
      somewhat dry, they had taken the question of amusement into their own
      hands; and the lecturer (along with the board schoolmaster, the Baptist
      clergyman, and a working-man&rsquo;s candidate, who made up his bodyguard) was
      ultimately driven from the scene. Morris had not been present on that
      fatal day; if he had, he would have recognized a certain fighting glitter
      in his uncle&rsquo;s eye, and a certain chewing movement of his lips, as old
      acquaintances. But even to the inexpert these symptoms breathed of
      something dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;I have no wish to bother you further till we
      get to London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph did not so much as look at him in answer; with tremulous hands he
      produced a copy of the British Mechanic, and ostentatiously buried himself
      in its perusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what can make him so cantankerous?&rsquo; reflected the nephew. &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t like the look of it at all.&rsquo; And he dubiously scratched his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train travelled forth into the world, bearing along with it the
      customary freight of obliterated voyagers, and along with these old
      Joseph, affecting immersion in his paper, and John slumbering over the
      columns of the Pink Un, and Morris revolving in his mind a dozen grudges,
      and suspicions, and alarms. It passed Christchurch by the sea, Herne with
      its pinewoods, Ringwood on its mazy river. A little behind time, but not
      much for the South-Western, it drew up at the platform of a station, in
      the midst of the New Forest, the real name of which (in case the railway
      company &lsquo;might have the law of me&rsquo;) I shall veil under the alias of
      Browndean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many passengers put their heads to the window, and among the rest an old
      gentleman on whom I willingly dwell, for I am nearly done with him now,
      and (in the whole course of the present narrative) I am not in the least
      likely to meet another character so decent. His name is immaterial, not so
      his habits. He had passed his life wandering in a tweed suit on the
      continent of Europe; and years of Galignani&rsquo;s Messenger having at length
      undermined his eyesight, he suddenly remembered the rivers of Assyria and
      came to London to consult an oculist. From the oculist to the dentist, and
      from both to the physician, the step appears inevitable; presently he was
      in the hands of Sir Faraday, robed in ventilating cloth and sent to
      Bournemouth; and to that domineering baronet (who was his only friend upon
      his native soil) he was now returning to report. The case of these
      tweedsuited wanderers is unique. We have all seen them entering the table
      d&rsquo;hote (at Spezzia, or Grdtz, or Venice) with a genteel melancholy and a
      faint appearance of having been to India and not succeeded. In the offices
      of many hundred hotels they are known by name; and yet, if the whole of
      this wandering cohort were to disappear tomorrow, their absence would be
      wholly unremarked. How much more, if only one&mdash;say this one in the
      ventilating cloth&mdash;should vanish! He had paid his bills at
      Bournemouth; his worldly effects were all in the van in two portmanteaux,
      and these after the proper interval would be sold as unclaimed baggage to
      a Jew; Sir Faraday&rsquo;s butler would be a half-crown poorer at the year&rsquo;s
      end, and the hotelkeepers of Europe about the same date would be mourning
      a small but quite observable decline in profits. And that would be
      literally all. Perhaps the old gentleman thought something of the sort,
      for he looked melancholy enough as he pulled his bare, grey head back into
      the carriage, and the train smoked under the bridge, and forth, with ever
      quickening speed, across the mingled heaths and woods of the New Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many hundred yards beyond Browndean, however, a sudden jarring of
      brakes set everybody&rsquo;s teeth on edge, and there was a brutal stoppage.
      Morris Finsbury was aware of a confused uproar of voices, and sprang to
      the window. Women were screaming, men were tumbling from the windows on
      the track, the guard was crying to them to stay where they were; at the
      same time the train began to gather way and move very slowly backward
      toward Browndean; and the next moment&mdash;, all these various sounds
      were blotted out in the apocalyptic whistle and the thundering onslaught
      of the down express.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual collision Morris did not hear. Perhaps he fainted. He had a
      wild dream of having seen the carriage double up and fall to pieces like a
      pantomime trick; and sure enough, when he came to himself, he was lying on
      the bare earth and under the open sky. His head ached savagely; he carried
      his hand to his brow, and was not surprised to see it red with blood. The
      air was filled with an intolerable, throbbing roar, which he expected to
      find die away with the return of consciousness; and instead of that it
      seemed but to swell the louder and to pierce the more cruelly through his
      ears. It was a raging, bellowing thunder, like a boiler-riveting factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now curiosity began to stir, and he sat up and looked about him. The
      track at this point ran in a sharp curve about a wooded hillock; all of
      the near side was heaped with the wreckage of the Bournemouth train; that
      of the express was mostly hidden by the trees; and just at the turn, under
      clouds of vomiting steam and piled about with cairns of living coal, lay
      what remained of the two engines, one upon the other. On the heathy margin
      of the line were many people running to and fro, and crying aloud as they
      ran, and many others lying motionless like sleeping tramps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris suddenly drew an inference. &lsquo;There has been an accident&rsquo; thought
      he, and was elated at his perspicacity. Almost at the same time his eye
      lighted on John, who lay close by as white as paper. &lsquo;Poor old John! poor
      old cove!&rsquo; he thought, the schoolboy expression popping forth from some
      forgotten treasury, and he took his brother&rsquo;s hand in his with childish
      tenderness. It was perhaps the touch that recalled him; at least John
      opened his eyes, sat suddenly up, and after several ineffectual movements
      of his lips, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rsquo; said he, in a phantom voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The din of that devil&rsquo;s smithy still thundered in their ears. &lsquo;Let us get
      away from that,&rsquo; Morris cried, and pointed to the vomit of steam that
      still spouted from the broken engines. And the pair helped each other up,
      and stood and quaked and wavered and stared about them at the scene of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then they were approached by a party of men who had already organized
      themselves for the purposes of rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you hurt?&rsquo; cried one of these, a young fellow with the sweat
      streaming down his pallid face, and who, by the way he was treated, was
      evidently the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris shook his head, and the young man, nodding grimly, handed him a
      bottle of some spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take a drink of that,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;your friend looks as if he needed it
      badly. We want every man we can get,&rsquo; he added; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s terrible work
      before us, and nobody should shirk. If you can do no more, you can carry a
      stretcher.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was hardly gone before Morris, under the spur of the dram,
      awoke to the full possession of his wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Uncle Joseph!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;where can he be? He can&rsquo;t be far off. I hope the old
      party isn&rsquo;t damaged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come and help me to look,&rsquo; said Morris, with a snap of savage
      determination strangely foreign to his ordinary bearing; and then, for one
      moment, he broke forth. &lsquo;If he&rsquo;s dead!&rsquo; he cried, and shook his fist at
      heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      To and fro the brothers hurried, staring in the faces of the wounded, or
      turning the dead upon their backs. They must have thus examined forty
      people, and still there was no word of Uncle Joseph. But now the course of
      their search brought them near the centre of the collision, where the
      boilers were still blowing off steam with a deafening clamour. It was a
      part of the field not yet gleaned by the rescuing party. The ground,
      especially on the margin of the wood, was full of inequalities&mdash;here
      a pit, there a hillock surmounted with a bush of furze. It was a place
      where many bodies might lie concealed, and they beat it like pointers
      after game. Suddenly Morris, who was leading, paused and reached forth his
      index with a tragic gesture. John followed the direction of his brother&rsquo;s
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bottom of a sandy hole lay something that had once been human. The
      face had suffered severely, and it was unrecognizable; but that was not
      required. The snowy hair, the coat of marten, the ventilating cloth, the
      hygienic flannel&mdash;everything down to the health boots from Messrs
      Dail and Crumbie&rsquo;s, identified the body as that of Uncle Joseph. Only the
      forage cap must have been lost in the convulsion, for the dead man was
      bareheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poor old beggar!&rsquo; said John, with a touch of natural feeling; &lsquo;I
      would give ten pounds if we hadn&rsquo;t chivvied him in the train!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no sentiment in the face of Morris as he gazed upon the
      dead. Gnawing his nails, with introverted eyes, his brow marked with the
      stamp of tragic indignation and tragic intellectual effort, he stood there
      silent. Here was a last injustice; he had been robbed while he was an
      orphan at school, he had been lashed to a decadent leather business, he
      had been saddled with Miss Hazeltine, his cousin had been defrauding him
      of the tontine, and he had borne all this, we might almost say, with
      dignity, and now they had gone and killed his uncle!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; he said suddenly, &lsquo;take his heels, we must get him into the woods.
      I&rsquo;m not going to have anybody find this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, fudge!&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;where&rsquo;s the use?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do what I tell you,&rsquo; spirted Morris, as he took the corpse by the
      shoulders. &lsquo;Am I to carry him myself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were close upon the borders of the wood; in ten or twelve paces they
      were under cover; and a little further back, in a sandy clearing of the
      trees, they laid their burthen down, and stood and looked at it with
      loathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean to do?&rsquo; whispered John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bury him, to be sure,&rsquo; responded Morris, and he opened his pocket-knife
      and began feverishly to dig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never make a hand of it with that,&rsquo; objected the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t help me, you cowardly shirk,&rsquo; screamed Morris, &lsquo;you can go
      to the devil!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the childishest folly,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;but no man shall call me a
      coward,&rsquo; and he began to help his brother grudgingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soil was sandy and light, but matted with the roots of the surrounding
      firs. Gorse tore their hands; and as they baled the sand from the grave,
      it was often discoloured with their blood. An hour passed of unremitting
      energy upon the part of Morris, of lukewarm help on that of John; and
      still the trench was barely nine inches in depth. Into this the body was
      rudely flung: sand was piled upon it, and then more sand must be dug, and
      gorse had to be cut to pile on that; and still from one end of the sordid
      mound a pair of feet projected and caught the light upon their
      patent-leather toes. But by this time the nerves of both were shaken; even
      Morris had enough of his grisly task; and they skulked off like animals
      into the thickest of the neighbouring covert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the best that we can do,&rsquo; said Morris, sitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll have the politeness to tell me what
      it&rsquo;s all about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word,&rsquo; cried Morris, &lsquo;if you do not understand for yourself, I
      almost despair of telling you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, of course it&rsquo;s some rot about the tontine,&rsquo; returned the other. &lsquo;But
      it&rsquo;s the merest nonsense. We&rsquo;ve lost it, and there&rsquo;s an end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; said Morris, &lsquo;Uncle Masterman is dead. I know it, there&rsquo;s a
      voice that tells me so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and so is Uncle Joseph,&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not dead, unless I choose,&rsquo; returned Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And come to that,&rsquo; cried John, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;re right, and Uncle Masterman&rsquo;s
      been dead ever so long, all we have to do is to tell the truth and expose
      Michael.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem to think Michael is a fool,&rsquo; sneered Morris. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you
      understand he&rsquo;s been preparing this fraud for years? He has the whole
      thing ready: the nurse, the doctor, the undertaker, all bought, the
      certificate all ready but the date! Let him get wind of this business, and
      you mark my words, Uncle Masterman will die in two days and be buried in a
      week. But see here, Johnny; what Michael can do, I can do. If he plays a
      game of bluff, so can I. If his father is to live for ever, by God, so
      shall my uncle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s illegal, ain&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man must have SOME moral courage,&rsquo; replied Morris with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then suppose you&rsquo;re wrong? Suppose Uncle Masterman&rsquo;s alive and
      kicking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, even then,&rsquo; responded the plotter, &lsquo;we are no worse off than we
      were before; in fact, we&rsquo;re better. Uncle Masterman must die some day; as
      long as Uncle Joseph was alive, he might have died any day; but we&rsquo;re out
      of all that trouble now: there&rsquo;s no sort of limit to the game that I
      propose&mdash;it can be kept up till Kingdom Come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could only see how you meant to set about it&rsquo; sighed John. &lsquo;But you
      know, Morris, you always were such a bungler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what I ever bungled,&rsquo; cried Morris; &lsquo;I have the best
      collection of signet rings in London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you know, there&rsquo;s the leather business,&rsquo; suggested the other.
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s considered rather a hash.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a mark of singular self-control in Morris that he suffered this to
      pass unchallenged, and even unresented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About the business in hand,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;once we can get him up to
      Bloomsbury, there&rsquo;s no sort of trouble. We bury him in the cellar, which
      seems made for it; and then all I have to do is to start out and find a
      venal doctor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t we leave him where he is?&rsquo; asked John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because we know nothing about the country,&rsquo; retorted Morris. &lsquo;This wood
      may be a regular lovers&rsquo; walk. Turn your mind to the real difficulty. How
      are we to get him up to Bloomsbury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Various schemes were mooted and rejected. The railway station at Browndean
      was, of course, out of the question, for it would now be a centre of
      curiosity and gossip, and (of all things) they would be least able to
      dispatch a dead body without remark. John feebly proposed getting an
      ale-cask and sending it as beer, but the objections to this course were so
      overwhelming that Morris scorned to answer. The purchase of a packing-case
      seemed equally hopeless, for why should two gentlemen without baggage of
      any kind require a packing-case? They would be more likely to require
      clean linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are working on wrong lines,&rsquo; cried Morris at last. &lsquo;The thing must be
      gone about more carefully. Suppose now,&rsquo; he added excitedly, speaking by
      fits and starts, as if he were thinking aloud, &lsquo;suppose we rent a cottage
      by the month. A householder can buy a packing-case without remark. Then
      suppose we clear the people out today, get the packing-case tonight, and
      tomorrow I hire a carriage or a cart that we could drive ourselves&mdash;and
      take the box, or whatever we get, to Ringwood or Lyndhurst or somewhere;
      we could label it &ldquo;specimens&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t you see? Johnny, I believe I&rsquo;ve hit
      the nail at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it sounds more feasible,&rsquo; admitted John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course we must take assumed names,&rsquo; continued Morris. &lsquo;It would never
      do to keep our own. What do you say to &ldquo;Masterman&rdquo; itself? It sounds quiet
      and dignified.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will NOT take the name of Masterman,&rsquo; returned his brother; &lsquo;you may,
      if you like. I shall call myself Vance&mdash;the Great Vance; positively
      the last six nights. There&rsquo;s some go in a name like that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vance?&rsquo; cried Morris. &lsquo;Do you think we are playing a pantomime for our
      amusement? There was never anybody named Vance who wasn&rsquo;t a music-hall
      singer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of it,&rsquo; returned John; &lsquo;it gives you some standing at
      once. You may call yourself Fortescue till all&rsquo;s blue, and nobody cares;
      but to be Vance gives a man a natural nobility.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s lots of other theatrical names,&rsquo; cried Morris. &lsquo;Leybourne,
      Irving, Brough, Toole&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devil a one will I take!&rsquo; returned his brother. &lsquo;I am going to have my
      little lark out of this as well as you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Morris, who perceived that John was determined to carry
      his point, &lsquo;I shall be Robert Vance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I shall be George Vance,&rsquo; cried John, &lsquo;the only original George
      Vance! Rally round the only original!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Repairing as well as they were able the disorder of their clothes, the
      Finsbury brothers returned to Browndean by a circuitous route in quest of
      luncheon and a suitable cottage. It is not always easy to drop at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice on a furnished residence in a retired locality; but
      fortune presently introduced our adventurers to a deaf carpenter, a man
      rich in cottages of the required description, and unaffectedly eager to
      supply their wants. The second place they visited, standing, as it did,
      about a mile and a half from any neighbours, caused them to exchange a
      glance of hope. On a nearer view, the place was not without depressing
      features. It stood in a marshy-looking hollow of a heath; tall trees
      obscured its windows; the thatch visibly rotted on the rafters; and the
      walls were stained with splashes of unwholesome green. The rooms were
      small, the ceilings low, the furniture merely nominal; a strange chill and
      a haunting smell of damp pervaded the kitchen; and the bedroom boasted
      only of one bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris, with a view to cheapening the place, remarked on this defect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; returned the man; &lsquo;if you can&rsquo;t sleep two abed, you&rsquo;d better take
      a villa residence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then,&rsquo; pursued Morris, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no water. How do you get your water?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We fill THAT from the spring,&rsquo; replied the carpenter, pointing to a big
      barrel that stood beside the door. &lsquo;The spring ain&rsquo;t so VERY far off,
      after all, and it&rsquo;s easy brought in buckets. There&rsquo;s a bucket there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris nudged his brother as they examined the water-butt. It was new, and
      very solidly constructed for its office. If anything had been wanting to
      decide them, this eminently practical barrel would have turned the scale.
      A bargain was promptly struck, the month&rsquo;s rent was paid upon the nail,
      and about an hour later the Finsbury brothers might have been observed
      returning to the blighted cottage, having along with them the key, which
      was the symbol of their tenancy, a spirit-lamp, with which they fondly
      told themselves they would be able to cook, a pork pie of suitable
      dimensions, and a quart of the worst whisky in Hampshire. Nor was this all
      they had effected; already (under the plea that they were
      landscape-painters) they had hired for dawn on the morrow a light but
      solid two-wheeled cart; so that when they entered in their new character,
      they were able to tell themselves that the back of the business was
      already broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      John proceeded to get tea; while Morris, foraging about the house, was
      presently delighted by discovering the lid of the water-butt upon the
      kitchen shelf. Here, then, was the packing-case complete; in the absence
      of straw, the blankets (which he himself, at least, had not the smallest
      intention of using for their present purpose) would exactly take the place
      of packing; and Morris, as the difficulties began to vanish from his path,
      rose almost to the brink of exultation. There was, however, one difficulty
      not yet faced, one upon which his whole scheme depended. Would John
      consent to remain alone in the cottage? He had not yet dared to put the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with high good-humour that the pair sat down to the deal table, and
      proceeded to fall-to on the pork pie. Morris retailed the discovery of the
      lid, and the Great Vance was pleased to applaud by beating on the table
      with his fork in true music-hall style.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the dodge,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I always said a water-butt was what you
      wanted for this business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Morris, thinking this a favourable opportunity to
      prepare his brother, &lsquo;of course you must stay on in this place till I give
      the word; I&rsquo;ll give out that uncle is resting in the New Forest. It would
      not do for both of us to appear in London; we could never conceal the
      absence of the old man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      John&rsquo;s jaw dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, come!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;You can stay in this hole yourself. I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour came into Morris&rsquo;s cheeks. He saw that he must win his brother
      at any cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must please remember, Johnny,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;the amount of the tontine.
      If I succeed, we shall have each fifty thousand to place to our bank
      account; ay, and nearer sixty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if you fail,&rsquo; returned John, &lsquo;what then? What&rsquo;ll be the colour of our
      bank account in that case?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will pay all expenses,&rsquo; said Morris, with an inward struggle; &lsquo;you
      shall lose nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said John, with a laugh, &lsquo;if the ex-s are yours, and half-profits
      mine, I don&rsquo;t mind remaining here for a couple of days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A couple of days!&rsquo; cried Morris, who was beginning to get angry and
      controlled himself with difficulty; &lsquo;why, you would do more to win five
      pounds on a horse-race!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I would,&rsquo; returned the Great Vance; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the artistic
      temperament.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is monstrous!&rsquo; burst out Morris. &lsquo;I take all risks; I pay all
      expenses; I divide profits; and you won&rsquo;t take the slightest pains to help
      me. It&rsquo;s not decent; it&rsquo;s not honest; it&rsquo;s not even kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose,&rsquo; objected John, who was considerably impressed by his
      brother&rsquo;s vehemence, &lsquo;suppose that Uncle Masterman is alive after all, and
      lives ten years longer; must I rot here all that time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; responded Morris, in a more conciliatory tone; &lsquo;I only
      ask a month at the outside; and if Uncle Masterman is not dead by that
      time you can go abroad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go abroad?&rsquo; repeated John eagerly. &lsquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I go at once? Tell &lsquo;em
      that Joseph and I are seeing life in Paris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but look here,&rsquo; said John; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s this house, it&rsquo;s such a pig-sty,
      it&rsquo;s so dreary and damp. You said yourself that it was damp.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to the carpenter,&rsquo; Morris distinguished, &lsquo;and that was to reduce the
      rent. But really, you know, now we&rsquo;re in it, I&rsquo;ve seen worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what am I to do?&rsquo; complained the victim. &lsquo;How can I entertain a
      friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Johnny, if you don&rsquo;t think the tontine worth a little trouble,
      say so, and I&rsquo;ll give the business up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re dead certain of the figures, I suppose?&rsquo; asked John. &lsquo;Well&rsquo;&mdash;with
      a deep sigh&mdash;&lsquo;send me the Pink Un and all the comic papers regularly.
      I&rsquo;ll face the music.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As afternoon drew on, the cottage breathed more thrillingly of its native
      marsh; a creeping chill inhabited its chambers; the fire smoked, and a
      shower of rain, coming up from the channel on a slant of wind, tingled on
      the window-panes. At intervals, when the gloom deepened toward despair,
      Morris would produce the whisky-bottle, and at first John welcomed the
      diversion&mdash;not for long. It has been said this spirit was the worst
      in Hampshire; only those acquainted with the county can appreciate the
      force of that superlative; and at length even the Great Vance (who was no
      connoisseur) waved the decoction from his lips. The approach of dusk,
      feebly combated with a single tallow candle, added a touch of tragedy; and
      John suddenly stopped whistling through his fingers&mdash;an art to the
      practice of which he had been reduced&mdash;and bitterly lamented his
      concessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here a month,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;No one could. The thing&rsquo;s
      nonsense, Morris. The parties that lived in the Bastille would rise
      against a place like this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With an admirable affectation of indifference, Morris proposed a game of
      pitch-and-toss. To what will not the diplomatist condescend! It was John&rsquo;s
      favourite game; indeed his only game&mdash;he had found all the rest too
      intellectual&mdash;and he played it with equal skill and good fortune. To
      Morris himself, on the other hand, the whole business was detestable; he
      was a bad pitcher, he had no luck in tossing, and he was one who suffered
      torments when he lost. But John was in a dangerous humour, and his brother
      was prepared for any sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      By seven o&rsquo;clock, Morris, with incredible agony, had lost a couple of
      half-crowns. Even with the tontine before his eyes, this was as much as he
      could bear; and, remarking that he would take his revenge some other time,
      he proposed a bit of supper and a grog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before they had made an end of this refreshment it was time to be at work.
      A bucket of water for present necessities was withdrawn from the
      water-butt, which was then emptied and rolled before the kitchen fire to
      dry; and the two brothers set forth on their adventure under a starless
      heaven.

      CHAPTER III. The Lecturer at Large
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whether mankind is really partial to happiness is an open question. Not a
      month passes by but some cherished son runs off into the merchant service,
      or some valued husband decamps to Texas with a lady help; clergymen have
      fled from their parishioners; and even judges have been known to retire.
      To an open mind, it will appear (upon the whole) less strange that Joseph
      Finsbury should have been led to entertain ideas of escape. His lot (I
      think we may say) was not a happy one. My friend, Mr Morris, with whom I
      travel up twice or thrice a week from Snaresbrook Park, is certainly a
      gentleman whom I esteem; but he was scarce a model nephew. As for John, he
      is of course an excellent fellow; but if he was the only link that bound
      one to a home, I think the most of us would vote for foreign travel. In
      the case of Joseph, John (if he were a link at all) was not the only one;
      endearing bonds had long enchained the old gentleman to Bloomsbury; and by
      these expressions I do not in the least refer to Julia Hazeltine (of whom,
      however, he was fond enough), but to that collection of manuscript
      notebooks in which his life lay buried. That he should ever have made up
      his mind to separate himself from these collections, and go forth upon the
      world with no other resources than his memory supplied, is a circumstance
      highly pathetic in itself, and but little creditable to the wisdom of his
      nephews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design, or at least the temptation, was already some months old; and
      when a bill for eight hundred pounds, payable to himself, was suddenly
      placed in Joseph&rsquo;s hand, it brought matters to an issue. He retained that
      bill, which, to one of his frugality, meant wealth; and he promised
      himself to disappear among the crowds at Waterloo, or (if that should
      prove impossible) to slink out of the house in the course of the evening
      and melt like a dream into the millions of London. By a peculiar
      interposition of Providence and railway mismanagement he had not so long
      to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of the first to come to himself and scramble to his feet after
      the Browndean catastrophe, and he had no sooner remarked his prostrate
      nephews than he understood his opportunity and fled. A man of upwards of
      seventy, who has just met with a railway accident, and who is cumbered
      besides with the full uniform of Sir Faraday Bond, is not very likely to
      flee far, but the wood was close at hand and offered the fugitive at least
      a temporary covert. Hither, then, the old gentleman skipped with
      extraordinary expedition, and, being somewhat winded and a good deal
      shaken, here he lay down in a convenient grove and was presently
      overwhelmed by slumber. The way of fate is often highly entertaining to
      the looker-on, and it is certainly a pleasant circumstance, that while
      Morris and John were delving in the sand to conceal the body of a total
      stranger, their uncle lay in dreamless sleep a few hundred yards deeper in
      the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was awakened by the jolly note of a bugle from the neighbouring high
      road, where a char-a-banc was bowling by with some belated tourists. The
      sound cheered his old heart, it directed his steps into the bargain, and
      soon he was on the highway, looking east and west from under his vizor,
      and doubtfully revolving what he ought to do. A deliberate sound of wheels
      arose in the distance, and then a cart was seen approaching, well filled
      with parcels, driven by a good-natured looking man on a double bench, and
      displaying on a board the legend, &lsquo;I Chandler, carrier&rsquo;. In the infamously
      prosaic mind of Mr Finsbury, certain streaks of poetry survived and were
      still efficient; they had carried him to Asia Minor as a giddy youth of
      forty, and now, in the first hours of his recovered freedom, they
      suggested to him the idea of continuing his flight in Mr Chandler&rsquo;s cart.
      It would be cheap; properly broached, it might even cost nothing, and,
      after years of mittens and hygienic flannel, his heart leaped out to meet
      the notion of exposure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chandler was perhaps a little puzzled to find so old a gentleman, so
      strangely clothed, and begging for a lift on so retired a roadside. But he
      was a good-natured man, glad to do a service, and so he took the stranger
      up; and he had his own idea of civility, and so he asked no questions.
      Silence, in fact, was quite good enough for Mr Chandler; but the cart had
      scarcely begun to move forward ere he found himself involved in a
      one-sided conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can see,&rsquo; began Mr Finsbury, &lsquo;by the mixture of parcels and boxes that
      are contained in your cart, each marked with its individual label, and by
      the good Flemish mare you drive, that you occupy the post of carrier in
      that great English system of transport which, with all its defects, is the
      pride of our country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr Chandler vaguely, for he hardly knew what to
      reply; &lsquo;them parcels posts has done us carriers a world of harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not a prejudiced man,&rsquo; continued Joseph Finsbury. &lsquo;As a young man I
      travelled much. Nothing was too small or too obscure for me to acquire. At
      sea I studied seamanship, learned the complicated knots employed by
      mariners, and acquired the technical terms. At Naples, I would learn the
      art of making macaroni; at Nice, the principles of making candied fruit. I
      never went to the opera without first buying the book of the piece, and
      making myself acquainted with the principal airs by picking them out on
      the piano with one finger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have seen a deal, sir,&rsquo; remarked the carrier, touching up his
      horse; &lsquo;I wish I could have had your advantages.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know how often the word whip occurs in the Old Testament?&rsquo; 
      continued the old gentleman. &lsquo;One hundred and (if I remember exactly)
      forty-seven times.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do it indeed, sir?&rsquo; said Mr Chandler. &lsquo;I never should have thought it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Bible contains three million five hundred and one thousand two
      hundred and forty-nine letters. Of verses I believe there are upward of
      eighteen thousand. There have been many editions of the Bible; Wycliff was
      the first to introduce it into England about the year 1300. The &ldquo;Paragraph
      Bible&rdquo;, as it is called, is a well-known edition, and is so called because
      it is divided into paragraphs. The &ldquo;Breeches Bible&rdquo; is another well-known
      instance, and gets its name either because it was printed by one Breeches,
      or because the place of publication bore that name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The carrier remarked drily that he thought that was only natural, and
      turned his attention to the more congenial task of passing a cart of hay;
      it was a matter of some difficulty, for the road was narrow, and there was
      a ditch on either hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I perceive,&rsquo; began Mr Finsbury, when they had successfully passed the
      cart, &lsquo;that you hold your reins with one hand; you should employ two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I like that!&rsquo; cried the carrier contemptuously. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not understand,&rsquo; continued Mr Finsbury. &lsquo;What I tell you is a
      scientific fact, and reposes on the theory of the lever, a branch of
      mechanics. There are some very interesting little shilling books upon the
      field of study, which I should think a man in your station would take a
      pleasure to read. But I am afraid you have not cultivated the art of
      observation; at least we have now driven together for some time, and I
      cannot remember that you have contributed a single fact. This is a very
      false principle, my good man. For instance, I do not know if you observed
      that (as you passed the hay-cart man) you took your left?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I did,&rsquo; cried the carrier, who was now getting belligerent;
      &lsquo;he&rsquo;d have the law on me if I hadn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In France, now,&rsquo; resumed the old man, &lsquo;and also, I believe, in the
    </p>
    <p>
      United States of America, you would have taken the right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not,&rsquo; cried Mr Chandler indignantly. &lsquo;I would have taken the
      left.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I observe again,&rsquo; continued Mr Finsbury, scorning to reply, &lsquo;that you
      mend the dilapidated parts of your harness with string. I have always
      protested against this carelessness and slovenliness of the English poor.
      In an essay that I once read before an appreciative audience&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t string,&rsquo; said the carrier sullenly, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s pack-thread.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have always protested,&rsquo; resumed the old man, &lsquo;that in their private and
      domestic life, as well as in their labouring career, the lower classes of
      this country are improvident, thriftless, and extravagant. A stitch in
      time&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who the devil ARE the lower classes?&rsquo; cried the carrier. &lsquo;You are the
      lower classes yourself! If I thought you were a blooming aristocrat, I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have given you a lift.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were uttered with undisguised ill-feeling; it was plain the pair
      were not congenial, and further conversation, even to one of Mr Finsbury&rsquo;s
      pathetic loquacity, was out of the question. With an angry gesture, he
      pulled down the brim of the forage-cap over his eyes, and, producing a
      notebook and a blue pencil from one of his innermost pockets, soon became
      absorbed in calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his part the carrier fell to whistling with fresh zest; and if (now and
      again) he glanced at the companion of his drive, it was with mingled
      feelings of triumph and alarm&mdash;triumph because he had succeeded in
      arresting that prodigy of speech, and alarm lest (by any accident) it
      should begin again. Even the shower, which presently overtook and passed
      them, was endured by both in silence; and it was still in silence that
      they drove at length into Southampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dusk had fallen; the shop windows glimmered forth into the streets of the
      old seaport; in private houses lights were kindled for the evening meal;
      and Mr Finsbury began to think complacently of his night&rsquo;s lodging. He put
      his papers by, cleared his throat, and looked doubtfully at Mr Chandler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you be civil enough,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to recommend me to an inn?&rsquo; Mr
      Chandler pondered for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said at last, &lsquo;I wonder how about the &ldquo;Tregonwell Arms&rdquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The &ldquo;Tregonwell Arms&rdquo; will do very well,&rsquo; returned the old man, &lsquo;if it&rsquo;s
      clean and cheap, and the people civil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking so much of you,&rsquo; returned Mr Chandler thoughtfully. &lsquo;I
      was thinking of my friend Watts as keeps the &lsquo;ouse; he&rsquo;s a friend of mine,
      you see, and he helped me through my trouble last year. And I was
      thinking, would it be fair-like on Watts to saddle him with an old party
      like you, who might be the death of him with general information. Would it
      be fair to the &lsquo;ouse?&rsquo; enquired Mr Chandler, with an air of candid appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mark me,&rsquo; cried the old gentleman with spirit. &lsquo;It was kind in you to
      bring me here for nothing, but it gives you no right to address me in such
      terms. Here&rsquo;s a shilling for your trouble; and, if you do not choose to
      set me down at the &ldquo;Tregonwell Arms&rdquo;, I can find it for myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Chandler was surprised and a little startled; muttering something
      apologetic, he returned the shilling, drove in silence through several
      intricate lanes and small streets, drew up at length before the bright
      windows of an inn, and called loudly for Mr Watts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that you, Jem?&rsquo; cried a hearty voice from the stableyard. &lsquo;Come in and
      warm yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only stopped here,&rsquo; Mr Chandler explained, &lsquo;to let down an old gent
      that wants food and lodging. Mind, I warn you agin him; he&rsquo;s worse nor a
      temperance lecturer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Finsbury dismounted with difficulty, for he was cramped with his long
      drive, and the shaking he had received in the accident. The friendly Mr
      Watts, in spite of the carter&rsquo;s scarcely agreeable introduction, treated
      the old gentleman with the utmost courtesy, and led him into the back
      parlour, where there was a big fire burning in the grate. Presently a
      table was spread in the same room, and he was invited to seat himself
      before a stewed fowl&mdash;somewhat the worse for having seen service
      before&mdash;and a big pewter mug of ale from the tap.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from supper a giant refreshed; and, changing his seat to one
      nearer the fire, began to examine the other guests with an eye to the
      delights of oratory. There were near a dozen present, all men, and (as
      Joseph exulted to perceive) all working men. Often already had he seen
      cause to bless that appetite for disconnected fact and rotatory argument
      which is so marked a character of the mechanic. But even an audience of
      working men has to be courted, and there was no man more deeply versed in
      the necessary arts than Joseph Finsbury. He placed his glasses on his
      nose, drew from his pocket a bundle of papers, and spread them before him
      on a table. He crumpled them, he smoothed them out; now he skimmed them
      over, apparently well pleased with their contents; now, with tapping
      pencil and contracted brows, he seemed maturely to consider some
      particular statement. A stealthy glance about the room assured him of the
      success of his manoeuvres; all eyes were turned on the performer, mouths
      were open, pipes hung suspended; the birds were charmed. At the same
      moment the entrance of Mr Watts afforded him an opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I observe,&rsquo; said he, addressing the landlord, but taking at the same time
      the whole room into his confidence with an encouraging look, &lsquo;I observe
      that some of these gentlemen are looking with curiosity in my direction;
      and certainly it is unusual to see anyone immersed in literary and
      scientific labours in the public apartment of an inn. I have here some
      calculations I made this morning upon the cost of living in this and other
      countries&mdash;a subject, I need scarcely say, highly interesting to the
      working classes. I have calculated a scale of living for incomes of
      eighty, one hundred and sixty, two hundred, and two hundred and forty
      pounds a year. I must confess that the income of eighty pounds has
      somewhat baffled me, and the others are not so exact as I could wish; for
      the price of washing varies largely in foreign countries, and the
      different cokes, coals and firewoods fluctuate surprisingly. I will read
      my researches, and I hope you won&rsquo;t scruple to point out to me any little
      errors that I may have committed either from oversight or ignorance. I
      will begin, gentlemen, with the income of eighty pounds a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the old gentleman, with less compassion than he would have had
      for brute beasts, delivered himself of all his tedious calculations. As he
      occasionally gave nine versions of a single income, placing the imaginary
      person in London, Paris, Bagdad, Spitzbergen, Bassorah, Heligoland, the
      Scilly Islands, Brighton, Cincinnati, and Nijni-Novgorod, with an
      appropriate outfit for each locality, it is no wonder that his hearers
      look back on that evening as the most tiresome they ever spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before Mr Finsbury had reached Nijni-Novgorod with the income of one
      hundred and sixty pounds, the company had dwindled and faded away to a few
      old topers and the bored but affable Watts. There was a constant stream of
      customers from the outer world, but so soon as they were served they drank
      their liquor quickly and departed with the utmost celerity for the next
      public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the young man with two hundred a year was vegetating in the
      Scilly Islands, Mr Watts was left alone with the economist; and that
      imaginary person had scarce commenced life at Brighton before the last of
      his pursuers desisted from the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Finsbury slept soundly after the manifold fatigues of the day. He rose
      late, and, after a good breakfast, ordered the bill. Then it was that he
      made a discovery which has been made by many others, both before and
      since: that it is one thing to order your bill, and another to discharge
      it. The items were moderate and (what does not always follow) the total
      small; but, after the most sedulous review of all his pockets, one and
      nine pence halfpenny appeared to be the total of the old gentleman&rsquo;s
      available assets. He asked to see Mr Watts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is a bill on London for eight hundred pounds,&rsquo; said Mr Finsbury, as
      that worthy appeared. &lsquo;I am afraid, unless you choose to discount it
      yourself, it may detain me a day or two till I can get it cashed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Watts looked at the bill, turned it over, and dogs-eared it with his
      fingers. &lsquo;It will keep you a day or two?&rsquo; he said, repeating the old man&rsquo;s
      words. &lsquo;You have no other money with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some trifling change,&rsquo; responded Joseph. &lsquo;Nothing to speak of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you can send it me; I should be pleased to trust you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To tell the truth,&rsquo; answered the old gentleman, &lsquo;I am more than half
      inclined to stay; I am in need of funds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If a loan of ten shillings would help you, it is at your service,&rsquo; 
      responded Watts, with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I think I would rather stay,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;and get my bill
      discounted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall not stay in my house,&rsquo; cried Mr Watts. &lsquo;This is the last time
      you shall have a bed at the &ldquo;Tregonwell Arms&rdquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I insist upon remaining,&rsquo; replied Mr Finsbury, with spirit; &lsquo;I remain by
      Act of Parliament; turn me out if you dare.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then pay your bill,&rsquo; said Mr Watts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take that,&rsquo; cried the old man, tossing him the negotiable bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not legal tender,&rsquo; replied Mr Watts. &lsquo;You must leave my house at
      once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot appreciate the contempt I feel for you, Mr Watts,&rsquo; said the
      old gentleman, resigning himself to circumstances. &lsquo;But you shall feel it
      in one way: I refuse to pay my bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for your bill,&rsquo; responded Mr Watts. &lsquo;What I want is your
      absence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you shall have!&rsquo; said the old gentleman, and, taking up his forage
      cap as he spoke, he crammed it on his head. &lsquo;Perhaps you are too
      insolent,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;to inform me of the time of the next London train?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It leaves in three-quarters of an hour,&rsquo; returned the innkeeper with
      alacrity. &lsquo;You can easily catch it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph&rsquo;s position was one of considerable weakness. On the one hand, it
      would have been well to avoid the direct line of railway, since it was
      there he might expect his nephews to lie in wait for his recapture; on the
      other, it was highly desirable, it was even strictly needful, to get the
      bill discounted ere it should be stopped. To London, therefore, he decided
      to proceed on the first train; and there remained but one point to be
      considered, how to pay his fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph&rsquo;s nails were never clean; he ate almost entirely with his knife. I
      doubt if you could say he had the manners of a gentleman; but he had
      better than that, a touch of genuine dignity. Was it from his stay in Asia
      Minor? Was it from a strain in the Finsbury blood sometimes alluded to by
      customers? At least, when he presented himself before the station-master,
      his salaam was truly Oriental, palm-trees appeared to crowd about the
      little office, and the simoom or the bulbul&mdash;but I leave this image
      to persons better acquainted with the East. His appearance, besides, was
      highly in his favour; the uniform of Sir Faraday, however inconvenient and
      conspicuous, was, at least, a costume in which no swindler could have
      hoped to prosper; and the exhibition of a valuable watch and a bill for
      eight hundred pounds completed what deportment had begun. A quarter of an
      hour later, when the train came up, Mr Finsbury was introduced to the
      guard and installed in a first-class compartment, the station-master
      smilingly assuming all responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the old gentleman sat waiting the moment of departure, he was the
      witness of an incident strangely connected with the fortunes of his house.
      A packing-case of cyclopean bulk was borne along the platform by some
      dozen of tottering porters, and ultimately, to the delight of a
      considerable crowd, hoisted on board the van. It is often the cheering
      task of the historian to direct attention to the designs and (if it may be
      reverently said) the artifices of Providence. In the luggage van, as
      Joseph was borne out of the station of Southampton East upon his way to
      London, the egg of his romance lay (so to speak) unhatched. The huge
      packing-case was directed to lie at Waterloo till called for, and
      addressed to one &lsquo;William Dent Pitman&rsquo;; and the very next article, a
      goodly barrel jammed into the corner of the van, bore the superscription,
      &lsquo;M. Finsbury, 16 John Street, Bloomsbury. Carriage paid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this juxtaposition, the train of powder was prepared; and there was now
      wanting only an idle hand to fire it off.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. The Magistrate in the Luggage Van
    </h2>
    <p>
      The city of Winchester is famed for a cathedral, a bishop&mdash;but he was
      unfortunately killed some years ago while riding&mdash;a public school, a
      considerable assortment of the military, and the deliberate passage of the
      trains of the London and South-Western line. These and many similar
      associations would have doubtless crowded on the mind of Joseph Finsbury;
      but his spirit had at that time flitted from the railway compartment to a
      heaven of populous lecture-halls and endless oratory. His body, in the
      meanwhile, lay doubled on the cushions, the forage-cap rakishly tilted
      back after the fashion of those that lie in wait for nursery-maids, the
      poor old face quiescent, one arm clutching to his heart Lloyd&rsquo;s Weekly
      Newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him, thus unconscious, enter and exeunt again a pair of voyagers. These
      two had saved the train and no more. A tandem urged to its last speed, an
      act of something closely bordering on brigandage at the ticket office, and
      a spasm of running, had brought them on the platform just as the engine
      uttered its departing snort. There was but one carriage easily within
      their reach; and they had sprung into it, and the leader and elder already
      had his feet upon the floor, when he observed Mr Finsbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Uncle Joseph! This&rsquo;ll never do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he backed out, almost upsetting his companion, and once more closed
      the door upon the sleeping patriarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the pair had jumped into the baggage van.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the row about your Uncle Joseph?&rsquo; enquired the younger traveller,
      mopping his brow. &lsquo;Does he object to smoking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s anything the row with him,&rsquo; returned the other.
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s by no means the first comer, my Uncle Joseph, I can tell you! Very
      respectable old gentleman; interested in leather; been to Asia Minor; no
      family, no assets&mdash;and a tongue, my dear Wickham, sharper than a
      serpent&rsquo;s tooth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cantankerous old party, eh?&rsquo; suggested Wickham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in the least,&rsquo; cried the other; &lsquo;only a man with a solid talent for
      being a bore; rather cheery I dare say, on a desert island, but on a
      railway journey insupportable. You should hear him on Tonti, the ass that
      started tontines. He&rsquo;s incredible on Tonti.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; cried Wickham, &lsquo;then you&rsquo;re one of these Finsbury tontine
      fellows. I hadn&rsquo;t a guess of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;do you know that old boy in the carriage is worth a
      hundred thousand pounds to me? There he was asleep, and nobody there but
      you! But I spared him, because I&rsquo;m a Conservative in politics.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wickham, pleased to be in a luggage van, was flitting to and fro like a
      gentlemanly butterfly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jingo!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s something for you! &ldquo;M. Finsbury, 16 John
      Street, Bloomsbury, London.&rdquo; M. stands for Michael, you sly dog; you keep
      two establishments, do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, that&rsquo;s Morris,&rsquo; responded Michael from the other end of the van, where
      he had found a comfortable seat upon some sacks. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a little cousin of
      mine. I like him myself, because he&rsquo;s afraid of me. He&rsquo;s one of the
      ornaments of Bloomsbury, and has a collection of some kind&mdash;birds&rsquo; 
      eggs or something that&rsquo;s supposed to be curious. I bet it&rsquo;s nothing to my
      clients!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a lark it would be to play billy with the labels!&rsquo; chuckled Mr
      Wickham. &lsquo;By George, here&rsquo;s a tack-hammer! We might send all these things
      skipping about the premises like what&rsquo;s-his-name!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the guard, surprised by the sound of voices, opened the
      door of his little cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had best step in here, gentlemen,&rsquo; said he, when he had heard their
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you come, Wickham?&rsquo; asked Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Catch me&mdash;I want to travel in a van,&rsquo; replied the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the door of communication was closed; and for the rest of the run
      Mr Wickham was left alone over his diversions on the one side, and on the
      other Michael and the guard were closeted together in familiar talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can get you a compartment here, sir,&rsquo; observed the official, as the
      train began to slacken speed before Bishopstoke station. &lsquo;You had best get
      out at my door, and I can bring your friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Wickham, whom we left (as the reader has shrewdly suspected) beginning
      to &lsquo;play billy&rsquo; with the labels in the van, was a young gentleman of much
      wealth, a pleasing but sandy exterior, and a highly vacant mind. Not many
      months before, he had contrived to get himself blackmailed by the family
      of a Wallachian Hospodar, resident for political reasons in the gay city
      of Paris. A common friend (to whom he had confided his distress)
      recommended him to Michael; and the lawyer was no sooner in possession of
      the facts than he instantly assumed the offensive, fell on the flank of
      the Wallachian forces, and, in the inside of three days, had the
      satisfaction to behold them routed and fleeing for the Danube. It is no
      business of ours to follow them on this retreat, over which the police
      were so obliging as to preside paternally. Thus relieved from what he
      loved to refer to as the Bulgarian Atrocity, Mr Wickham returned to London
      with the most unbounded and embarrassing gratitude and admiration for his
      saviour. These sentiments were not repaid either in kind or degree;
      indeed, Michael was a trifle ashamed of his new client&rsquo;s friendship; it
      had taken many invitations to get him to Winchester and Wickham Manor; but
      he had gone at last, and was now returning. It has been remarked by some
      judicious thinker (possibly J. F. Smith) that Providence despises to
      employ no instrument, however humble; and it is now plain to the dullest
      that both Mr Wickham and the Wallachian Hospodar were liquid lead and
      wedges in the hand of Destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smitten with the desire to shine in Michael&rsquo;s eyes and show himself a
      person of original humour and resources, the young gentleman (who was a
      magistrate, more by token, in his native county) was no sooner alone in
      the van than he fell upon the labels with all the zeal of a reformer; and,
      when he rejoined the lawyer at Bishopstoke, his face was flushed with his
      exertions, and his cigar, which he had suffered to go out was almost
      bitten in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By George, but this has been a lark!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sent the wrong
      thing to everybody in England. These cousins of yours have a packing-case
      as big as a house. I&rsquo;ve muddled the whole business up to that extent,
      Finsbury, that if it were to get out it&rsquo;s my belief we should get
      lynched.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was useless to be serious with Mr Wickham. &lsquo;Take care,&rsquo; said Michael.
      &lsquo;I am getting tired of your perpetual scrapes; my reputation is beginning
      to suffer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your reputation will be all gone before you finish with me,&rsquo; replied his
      companion with a grin. &lsquo;Clap it in the bill, my boy. &ldquo;For total loss of
      reputation, six and eightpence.&rdquo; But,&rsquo; continued Mr Wickham with more
      seriousness, &lsquo;could I be bowled out of the Commission for this little
      jest? I know it&rsquo;s small, but I like to be a JP. Speaking as a professional
      man, do you think there&rsquo;s any risk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo; responded Michael, &lsquo;they&rsquo;ll chuck you out sooner or
      later. Somehow you don&rsquo;t give the effect of being a good magistrate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only wish I was a solicitor,&rsquo; retorted his companion, &lsquo;instead of a
      poor devil of a country gentleman. Suppose we start one of those tontine
      affairs ourselves; I to pay five hundred a year, and you to guarantee me
      against every misfortune except illness or marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It strikes me,&rsquo; remarked the lawyer with a meditative laugh, as he
      lighted a cigar, &lsquo;it strikes me that you must be a cursed nuisance in this
      world of ours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you really think so, Finsbury?&rsquo; responded the magistrate, leaning back
      in his cushions, delighted with the compliment. &lsquo;Yes, I suppose I am a
      nuisance. But, mind you, I have a stake in the country: don&rsquo;t forget that,
      dear boy.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. Mr Gideon Forsyth and the Gigantic Box
    </h2>
    <p>
      It has been mentioned that at Bournemouth Julia sometimes made
      acquaintances; it is true she had but a glimpse of them before the doors
      of John Street closed again upon its captives, but the glimpse was
      sometimes exhilarating, and the consequent regret was tempered with hope.
      Among those whom she had thus met a year before was a young barrister of
      the name of Gideon Forsyth.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three o&rsquo;clock of the eventful day when the magistrate tampered with
      the labels, a somewhat moody and distempered ramble had carried Mr Forsyth
      to the corner of John Street; and about the same moment Miss Hazeltine was
      called to the door of No. 16 by a thundering double knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Gideon Forsyth was a happy enough young man; he would have been happier
      if he had had more money and less uncle. One hundred and twenty pounds a
      year was all his store; but his uncle, Mr Edward Hugh Bloomfield,
      supplemented this with a handsome allowance and a great deal of advice,
      couched in language that would probably have been judged intemperate on
      board a pirate ship. Mr Bloomfield was indeed a figure quite peculiar to
      the days of Mr Gladstone; what we may call (for the lack of an accepted
      expression) a Squirradical. Having acquired years without experience, he
      carried into the Radical side of politics those noisy, after-dinner-table
      passions, which we are more accustomed to connect with Toryism in its
      severe and senile aspects. To the opinions of Mr Bradlaugh, in fact, he
      added the temper and the sympathies of that extinct animal, the Squire; he
      admired pugilism, he carried a formidable oaken staff, he was a reverent
      churchman, and it was hard to know which would have more volcanically
      stirred his choler&mdash;a person who should have defended the established
      church, or one who should have neglected to attend its celebrations. He
      had besides some levelling catchwords, justly dreaded in the family
      circle; and when he could not go so far as to declare a step un-English,
      he might still (and with hardly less effect) denounce it as unpractical.
      It was under the ban of this lesser excommunication that Gideon had
      fallen. His views on the study of law had been pronounced unpractical; and
      it had been intimated to him, in a vociferous interview punctuated with
      the oaken staff, that he must either take a new start and get a brief or
      two, or prepare to live on his own money.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder if Gideon was moody. He had not the slightest wish to modify his
      present habits; but he would not stand on that, since the recall of Mr
      Bloomfield&rsquo;s allowance would revolutionize them still more radically. He
      had not the least desire to acquaint himself with law; he had looked into
      it already, and it seemed not to repay attention; but upon this also he
      was ready to give way. In fact, he would go as far as he could to meet the
      views of his uncle, the Squirradical. But there was one part of the
      programme that appeared independent of his will. How to get a brief? there
      was the question. And there was another and a worse. Suppose he got one,
      should he prove the better man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he found his way barred by a crowd. A garishly illuminated van
      was backed against the kerb; from its open stern, half resting on the
      street, half supported by some glistening athletes, the end of the largest
      packing-case in the county of Middlesex might have been seen protruding;
      while, on the steps of the house, the burly person of the driver and the
      slim figure of a young girl stood as upon a stage, disputing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not for us,&rsquo; the girl was saying. &lsquo;I beg you to take it away; it
      couldn&rsquo;t get into the house, even if you managed to get it out of the
      van.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall leave it on the pavement, then, and M. Finsbury can arrange with
      the Vestry as he likes,&rsquo; said the vanman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am not M. Finsbury,&rsquo; expostulated the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are,&rsquo; said the vanman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must allow me to help you, Miss Hazeltine,&rsquo; said Gideon, putting out
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia gave a little cry of pleasure. &lsquo;O, Mr Forsyth,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I am so
      glad to see you; we must get this horrid thing, which can only have come
      here by mistake, into the house. The man says we&rsquo;ll have to take off the
      door, or knock two of our windows into one, or be fined by the Vestry or
      Custom House or something for leaving our parcels on the pavement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The men by this time had successfully removed the box from the van, had
      plumped it down on the pavement, and now stood leaning against it, or
      gazing at the door of No. 16, in visible physical distress and mental
      embarrassment. The windows of the whole street had filled, as if by magic,
      with interested and entertained spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      With as thoughtful and scientific an expression as he could assume, Gideon
      measured the doorway with his cane, while Julia entered his observations
      in a drawing-book. He then measured the box, and, upon comparing his data,
      found that there was just enough space for it to enter. Next, throwing off
      his coat and waistcoat, he assisted the men to take the door from its
      hinges. And lastly, all bystanders being pressed into the service, the
      packing-case mounted the steps upon some fifteen pairs of wavering legs&mdash;scraped,
      loudly grinding, through the doorway&mdash;and was deposited at length,
      with a formidable convulsion, in the far end of the lobby, which it almost
      blocked. The artisans of this victory smiled upon each other as the dust
      subsided. It was true they had smashed a bust of Apollo and ploughed the
      wall into deep ruts; but, at least, they were no longer one of the public
      spectacles of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said the vanman, &lsquo;I never see such a job.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon eloquently expressed his concurrence in this sentiment by pressing
      a couple of sovereigns in the man&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make it three, sir, and I&rsquo;ll stand Sam to everybody here!&rsquo; cried the
      latter, and, this having been done, the whole body of volunteer porters
      swarmed into the van, which drove off in the direction of the nearest
      reliable public-house. Gideon closed the door on their departure, and
      turned to Julia; their eyes met; the most uncontrollable mirth seized upon
      them both, and they made the house ring with their laughter. Then
      curiosity awoke in Julia&rsquo;s mind, and she went and examined the box, and
      more especially the label.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the strangest thing that ever happened,&rsquo; she said, with another
      burst of laughter. &lsquo;It is certainly Morris&rsquo;s handwriting, and I had a
      letter from him only this morning, telling me to expect a barrel. Is there
      a barrel coming too, do you think, Mr Forsyth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Statuary with Care, Fragile,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Gideon aloud from the painted
      warning on the box. &lsquo;Then you were told nothing about this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; responded Julia. &lsquo;O, Mr Forsyth, don&rsquo;t you think we might take a
      peep at it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; cried Gideon. &lsquo;Just let me have a hammer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come down, and I&rsquo;ll show you where it is,&rsquo; cried Julia. &lsquo;The shelf is too
      high for me to reach&rsquo;; and, opening the door of the kitchen stair, she
      bade Gideon follow her. They found both the hammer and a chisel; but
      Gideon was surprised to see no sign of a servant. He also discovered that
      Miss Hazeltine had a very pretty little foot and ankle; and the discovery
      embarrassed him so much that he was glad to fall at once upon the
      packing-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      He worked hard and earnestly, and dealt his blows with the precision of a
      blacksmith; Julia the while standing silently by his side, and regarding
      rather the workman than the work. He was a handsome fellow; she told
      herself she had never seen such beautiful arms. And suddenly, as though he
      had overheard these thoughts, Gideon turned and smiled to her. She, too,
      smiled and coloured; and the double change became her so prettily that
      Gideon forgot to turn away his eyes, and, swinging the hammer with a will,
      discharged a smashing blow on his own knuckles. With admirable presence of
      mind he crushed down an oath and substituted the harmless comment, &lsquo;Butter
      fingers!&rsquo; But the pain was sharp, his nerve was shaken, and after an
      abortive trial he found he must desist from further operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Julia was off to the pantry; in a moment she was back again
      with a basin of water and a sponge, and had begun to bathe his wounded
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am dreadfully sorry!&rsquo; said Gideon apologetically. &lsquo;If I had had any
      manners I should have opened the box first and smashed my hand afterward.
      It feels much better,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;I assure you it does.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now I think you are well enough to direct operations,&rsquo; said she.
      &lsquo;Tell me what to do, and I&rsquo;ll be your workman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very pretty workman,&rsquo; said Gideon, rather forgetting himself. She
      turned and looked at him, with a suspicion of a frown; and the indiscreet
      young man was glad to direct her attention to the packing-case. The bulk
      of the work had been accomplished; and presently Julia had burst through
      the last barrier and disclosed a zone of straw. in a moment they were
      kneeling side by side, engaged like haymakers; the next they were rewarded
      with a glimpse of something white and polished; and the next again laid
      bare an unmistakable marble leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is surely a very athletic person,&rsquo; said Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw anything like it,&rsquo; responded Gideon. &lsquo;His muscles stand out
      like penny rolls.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another leg was soon disclosed, and then what seemed to be a third. This
      resolved itself, however, into a knotted club resting upon a pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a Hercules,&rsquo; cried Gideon; &lsquo;I might have guessed that from his
      calf. I&rsquo;m supposed to be rather partial to statuary, but when it comes to
      Hercules, the police should interfere. I should say,&rsquo; he added, glancing
      with disaffection at the swollen leg, &lsquo;that this was about the biggest and
      the worst in Europe. What in heaven&rsquo;s name can have induced him to come
      here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose nobody else would have a gift of him,&rsquo; said Julia. &lsquo;And for
      that matter, I think we could have done without the monster very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t say that,&rsquo; returned Gideon. &lsquo;This has been one of the most
      amusing experiences of my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll forget it very soon,&rsquo; said Julia. &lsquo;Your hand will
      remind you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I suppose I must be going,&rsquo; said Gideon reluctantly. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; pleaded
      Julia. &lsquo;Why should you? Stay and have tea with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I thought you really wished me to stay,&rsquo; said Gideon, looking at his
      hat, &lsquo;of course I should only be too delighted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a silly person you must take me for!&rsquo; returned the girl. &lsquo;Why, of
      course I do; and, besides, I want some cakes for tea, and I&rsquo;ve nobody to
      send. Here is the latchkey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon put on his hat with alacrity, and casting one look at Miss
      Hazeltine, and another at the legs of Hercules, threw open the door and
      departed on his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned with a large bag of the choicest and most tempting of cakes
      and tartlets, and found Julia in the act of spreading a small tea-table in
      the lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rooms are all in such a state,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;that I thought we should
      be more cosy and comfortable in our own lobby, and under our own vine and
      statuary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ever so much better,&rsquo; cried Gideon delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O what adorable cream tarts!&rsquo; said Julia, opening the bag, &lsquo;and the
      dearest little cherry tartlets, with all the cherries spilled out into the
      cream!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Gideon, concealing his dismay, &lsquo;I knew they would mix
      beautifully; the woman behind the counter told me so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Julia, as they began their little festival, &lsquo;I am going to
      show you Morris&rsquo;s letter; read it aloud, please; perhaps there&rsquo;s something
      I have missed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon took the letter, and spreading it out on his knee, read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR JULIA, I write you from Browndean, where we are stopping over for a
      few days. Uncle was much shaken in that dreadful accident, of which, I
      dare say, you have seen the account. Tomorrow I leave him here with John,
      and come up alone; but before that, you will have received a barrel
      CONTAINING SPECIMENS FOR A FRIEND. Do not open it on any account, but
      leave it in the lobby till I come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours in haste,
    </p>
    <p>
      M. FINSBURY.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;Be sure and leave the barrel in the lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Gideon, &lsquo;there seems to be nothing about the monument,&rsquo; and he
      nodded, as he spoke, at the marble legs. &lsquo;Miss Hazeltine,&rsquo; he continued,
      &lsquo;would you mind me asking a few questions?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Julia; &lsquo;and if you can make me understand why
      Morris has sent a statue of Hercules instead of a barrel containing
      specimens for a friend, I shall be grateful till my dying day. And what
      are specimens for a friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t a guess,&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;Specimens are usually bits of stone,
      but rather smaller than our friend the monument. Still, that is not the
      point. Are you quite alone in this big house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am at present,&rsquo; returned Julia. &lsquo;I came up before them to prepare
      the house, and get another servant. But I couldn&rsquo;t get one I liked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are utterly alone,&rsquo; said Gideon in amazement. &lsquo;Are you not
      afraid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; responded Julia stoutly. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I should be more afraid
      than you would be; I am weaker, of course, but when I found I must sleep
      alone in the house I bought a revolver wonderfully cheap, and made the man
      show me how to use it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how do you use it?&rsquo; demanded Gideon, much amused at her courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said she, with a smile, &lsquo;you pull the little trigger thing on top,
      and then pointing it very low, for it springs up as you fire, you pull the
      underneath little trigger thing, and it goes off as well as if a man had
      done it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how often have you used it?&rsquo; asked Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I have not used it yet,&rsquo; said the determined young lady; &lsquo;but I know
      how, and that makes me wonderfully courageous, especially when I barricade
      my door with a chest of drawers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad they are coming back soon,&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;This business
      strikes me as excessively unsafe; if it goes on much longer, I could
      provide you with a maiden aunt of mine, or my landlady if you preferred.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lend me an aunt!&rsquo; cried Julia. &lsquo;O, what generosity! I begin to think it
      must have been you that sent the Hercules.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Believe me,&rsquo; cried the young man, &lsquo;I admire you too much to send you such
      an infamous work of art..&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia was beginning to reply, when they were both startled by a knocking
      at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, Mr Forsyth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my dear girl,&rsquo; said Gideon, laying his hand tenderly on
      her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it&rsquo;s the police,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;They are coming to complain
      about the statue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The knock was repeated. It was louder than before, and more impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Morris,&rsquo; cried Julia, in a startled voice, and she ran to the door
      and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed Morris that stood before them; not the Morris of ordinary
      days, but a wild-looking fellow, pale and haggard, with bloodshot eyes,
      and a two-days&rsquo; beard upon his chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The barrel!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the barrel that came this morning?&rsquo; And
      he stared about the lobby, his eyes, as they fell upon the legs of
      Hercules, literally goggling in his head. &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; he screamed.
      &lsquo;What is that waxwork? Speak, you fool! What is that? And where&rsquo;s the
      barrel&mdash;the water-butt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No barrel came, Morris,&rsquo; responded Julia coldly. &lsquo;This is the only thing
      that has arrived.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This!&rsquo; shrieked the miserable man. &lsquo;I never heard of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It came addressed in your hand,&rsquo; replied Julia; &lsquo;we had nearly to pull
      the house down to get it in, that is all that I can tell you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris gazed at her in utter bewilderment. He passed his hand over his
      forehead; he leaned against the wall like a man about to faint. Then his
      tongue was loosed, and he overwhelmed the girl with torrents of abuse.
      Such fire, such directness, such a choice of ungentlemanly language, none
      had ever before suspected Morris to possess; and the girl trembled and
      shrank before his fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall not speak to Miss Hazeltine in that way,&rsquo; said Gideon sternly.
      &lsquo;It is what I will not suffer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall speak to the girl as I like,&rsquo; returned Morris, with a fresh
      outburst of anger. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to the hussy as she deserves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word more, sir, not one word,&rsquo; cried Gideon. &lsquo;Miss Hazeltine,&rsquo; he
      continued, addressing the young girl, &lsquo;you cannot stay a moment longer in
      the same house with this unmanly fellow. Here is my arm; let me take you
      where you will be secure from insult.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Forsyth,&rsquo; returned Julia, &lsquo;you are right; I cannot stay here longer,
      and I am sure I trust myself to an honourable gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale and resolute, Gideon offered her his arm, and the pair descended the
      steps, followed by Morris clamouring for the latchkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia had scarcely handed the key to Morris before an empty hansom drove
      smartly into John Street. It was hailed by both men, and as the cabman
      drew up his restive horse, Morris made a dash into the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sixpence above fare,&rsquo; he cried recklessly. &lsquo;Waterloo Station for your
      life. Sixpence for yourself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make it a shilling, guv&rsquo;ner,&rsquo; said the man, with a grin; &lsquo;the other
      parties were first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A shilling then,&rsquo; cried Morris, with the inward reflection that he would
      reconsider it at Waterloo. The man whipped up his horse, and the hansom
      vanished from John Street.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI. The Tribulations of Morris: Part the First
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the hansom span through the streets of London, Morris sought to rally
      the forces of his mind. The water-butt with the dead body had miscarried,
      and it was essential to recover it. So much was clear; and if, by some
      blest good fortune, it was still at the station, all might be well. If it
      had been sent out, however, if it were already in the hands of some wrong
      person, matters looked more ominous. People who receive unexplained
      packages are usually keen to have them open; the example of Miss Hazeltine
      (whom he cursed again) was there to remind him of the circumstance; and if
      anyone had opened the water-butt&mdash;&lsquo;O Lord!&rsquo; cried Morris at the
      thought, and carried his hand to his damp forehead. The private conception
      of any breach of law is apt to be inspiriting, for the scheme (while yet
      inchoate) wears dashing and attractive colours. Not so in the least that
      part of the criminal&rsquo;s later reflections which deal with the police. That
      useful corps (as Morris now began to think) had scarce been kept
      sufficiently in view when he embarked upon his enterprise. &lsquo;I must play
      devilish close,&rsquo; he reflected, and he was aware of an exquisite thrill of
      fear in the region of the spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Main line or loop?&rsquo; enquired the cabman, through the scuttle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Main line,&rsquo; replied Morris, and mentally decided that the man should have
      his shilling after all. &lsquo;It would be madness to attract attention,&rsquo; 
      thought he. &lsquo;But what this thing will cost me, first and last, begins to
      be a nightmare!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the booking-office and wandered disconsolately on the
      platform. It was a breathing-space in the day&rsquo;s traffic. There were few
      people there, and these for the most part quiescent on the benches. Morris
      seemed to attract no remark, which was a good thing; but, on the other
      hand, he was making no progress in his quest. Something must be done,
      something must be risked. Every passing instant only added to his dangers.
      Summoning all his courage, he stopped a porter, and asked him if he
      remembered receiving a barrel by the morning train. He was anxious to get
      information, for the barrel belonged to a friend. &lsquo;It is a matter of some
      moment,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;for it contains specimens.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was not here this morning, sir,&rsquo; responded the porter, somewhat
      reluctantly, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll ask Bill. Do you recollect, Bill, to have got a
      barrel from Bournemouth this morning containing specimens?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about specimens,&rsquo; replied Bill; &lsquo;but the party as received
      the barrel I mean raised a sight of trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; cried Morris, in the agitation of the moment pressing a
      penny into the man&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see, sir, the barrel arrived at one-thirty. No one claimed it till
      about three, when a small, sickly&mdash;looking gentleman (probably a
      curate) came up, and sez he, &ldquo;Have you got anything for Pitman?&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Wili&rsquo;m Bent Pitman,&rdquo; if I recollect right. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rdquo; sez I,
      &ldquo;but I rather fancy that there barrel bears that name.&rdquo; The little man
      went up to the barrel, and seemed regularly all took aback when he saw the
      address, and then he pitched into us for not having brought what he
      wanted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a damn what you want,&rdquo; sez I to him, &ldquo;but if you are
      Will&rsquo;m Bent Pitman, there&rsquo;s your barrel.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and did he take it?&rsquo; cried the breathless Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; returned Bill, &lsquo;it appears it was a packing-case he was
      after. The packing-case came; that&rsquo;s sure enough, because it was about the
      biggest packing-case ever I clapped eyes on. And this Pitman he seemed a
      good deal cut up, and he had the superintendent out, and they got hold of
      the vanman&mdash;him as took the packing-case. Well, sir,&rsquo; continued Bill,
      with a smile, &lsquo;I never see a man in such a state. Everybody about that van
      was mortal, bar the horses. Some gen&rsquo;leman (as well as I could make out)
      had given the vanman a sov.; and so that was where the trouble come in,
      you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what did he say?&rsquo; gasped Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know as he SAID much, sir,&rsquo; said Bill. &lsquo;But he offered to fight
      this Pitman for a pot of beer. He had lost his book, too, and the
      receipts, and his men were all as mortal as himself. O, they were all
      like&rsquo;&mdash;and Bill paused for a simile&mdash;&lsquo;like lords! The
      superintendent sacked them on the spot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, come, but that&rsquo;s not so bad,&rsquo; said Morris, with a bursting sigh. &lsquo;He
      couldn&rsquo;t tell where he took the packing-case, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not he,&rsquo; said Bill, &lsquo;nor yet nothink else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&mdash;what did Pitman do?&rsquo; asked Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, he went off with the barrel in a four-wheeler, very trembling like,&rsquo; 
      replied Bill. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s a gentleman as has good health.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, so the barrel&rsquo;s gone,&rsquo; said Morris, half to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may depend on that, sir,&rsquo; returned the porter. &lsquo;But you had better
      see the superintendent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not in the least; it&rsquo;s of no account,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;It only contained
      specimens.&rsquo; And he walked hastily away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ensconced once more in a hansom, he proceeded to reconsider his position.
      Suppose (he thought), suppose he should accept defeat and declare his
      uncle&rsquo;s death at once? He should lose the tontine, and with that the last
      hope of his seven thousand eight hundred pounds. But on the other hand,
      since the shilling to the hansom cabman, he had begun to see that crime
      was expensive in its course, and, since the loss of the water-butt, that
      it was uncertain in its consequences. Quietly at first, and then with
      growing heat, he reviewed the advantages of backing out. It involved a
      loss; but (come to think of it) no such great loss after all; only that of
      the tontine, which had been always a toss-up, which at bottom he had never
      really expected. He reminded himself of that eagerly; he congratulated
      himself upon his constant moderation. He had never really expected the
      tontine; he had never even very definitely hoped to recover his seven
      thousand eight hundred pounds; he had been hurried into the whole thing by
      Michael&rsquo;s obvious dishonesty. Yes, it would probably be better to draw
      back from this high-flying venture, settle back on the leather business&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great God!&rsquo; cried Morris, bounding in the hansom like a Jack-in-a-box. &lsquo;I
      have not only not gained the tontine&mdash;I have lost the leather
      business!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the monstrous fact. He had no power to sign; he could not draw a
      cheque for thirty shillings. Until he could produce legal evidence of his
      uncle&rsquo;s death, he was a penniless outcast&mdash;and as soon as he produced
      it he had lost the tontine! There was no hesitation on the part of Morris;
      to drop the tontine like a hot chestnut, to concentrate all his forces on
      the leather business and the rest of his small but legitimate inheritance,
      was the decision of a single instant. And the next, the full extent of his
      calamity was suddenly disclosed to him. Declare his uncle&rsquo;s death? He
      couldn&rsquo;t! Since the body was lost Joseph had (in a legal sense) become
      immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no created vehicle big enough to contain Morris and his woes. He
      paid the hansom off and walked on he knew not whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I seem to have gone into this business with too much precipitation,&rsquo; he
      reflected, with a deadly sigh. &lsquo;I fear it seems too ramified for a person
      of my powers of mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a remark of his uncle&rsquo;s flashed into his memory: If you want to
      think clearly, put it all down on paper. &lsquo;Well, the old boy knew a thing
      or two,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;I will try; but I don&rsquo;t believe the paper was ever
      made that will clear my mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered a place of public entertainment, ordered bread and cheese, and
      writing materials, and sat down before them heavily. He tried the pen. It
      was an excellent pen, but what was he to write? &lsquo;I have it,&rsquo; cried Morris.
      &lsquo;Robinson Crusoe and the double columns!&rsquo; He prepared his paper after that
      classic model, and began as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Bad. &mdash;&mdash; Good.

     1. I have lost my uncle&rsquo;s body.

     1. But then Pitman has found it.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a bit,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;I am letting the spirit of antithesis run away
      with me. Let&rsquo;s start again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Bad. &mdash;&mdash; Good.

     1. I have lost my uncle&rsquo;s body.

     1. But then I no longer require to bury it.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     2. I have lost the tontine.

     2.But I may still save that if Pitman disposes of the body, and
     if I can find a physician who will stick at nothing.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     3. I have lost the leather business and the rest of my uncle&rsquo;s
     succession.

     3. But not if Pitman gives the body up to the police.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, but in that case I go to gaol; I had forgot that,&rsquo; thought Morris.
      &lsquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t know that I had better dwell on that hypothesis at all;
      it&rsquo;s all very well to talk of facing the worst; but in a case of this kind
      a man&rsquo;s first duty is to his own nerve. Is there any answer to No. 3? Is
      there any possible good side to such a beastly bungle? There must be, of
      course, or where would be the use of this double-entry business? And&mdash;by
      George, I have it!&rsquo; he exclaimed; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s exactly the same as the last!&rsquo; And
      he hastily re-wrote the passage:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Bad. &mdash;&mdash; Good.

     3. I have lost the leather business and the rest of my uncle&rsquo;s
     succession.

     3. But not if I can find a physician who will stick at nothing.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This venal doctor seems quite a desideratum,&rsquo; he reflected. &lsquo;I want him
      first to give me a certificate that my uncle is dead, so that I may get
      the leather business; and then that he&rsquo;s alive&mdash;but here we are again
      at the incompatible interests!&rsquo; And he returned to his tabulation:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Bad. &mdash;&mdash; Good.

     4. I have almost no money.

     4. But there is plenty in the bank.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     5. Yes, but I can&rsquo;t get the money in the bank.

     5. But&mdash;well, that seems unhappily to be the case.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     6. I have left the bill for eight hundred pounds in Uncle
     Joseph&rsquo;s pocket.

     6. But if Pitman is only a dishonest man, the presence of this
     bill may lead him to keep the whole thing dark and throw the body
     into the New Cut.
</pre>

     7. Yes, but if Pitman is dishonest and finds the bill, he will
     know who Joseph is, and he may blackmail me.

     7. Yes, but if I am right about Uncle Masterman, I can blackmail
     Michael.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     8. But I can&rsquo;t blackmail Michael (which is, besides, a very

     9. The leather business will soon want money for current

     10. Yes, but it&rsquo;s all the ship I have.

     10. A fact.

    <p>
      &lsquo;O, this seems to be a very one-sided business,&rsquo; exclaimed Morris.
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not so much in this method as I was led to think.&rsquo; He crumpled
      the paper up and threw it down; and then, the next moment, picked it up
      again and ran it over. &lsquo;It seems it&rsquo;s on the financial point that my
      position is weakest,&rsquo; he reflected. &lsquo;Is there positively no way of raising
      the wind? In a vast city like this, and surrounded by all the resources of
      civilization, it seems not to be conceived! Let us have no more
      precipitation. Is there nothing I can sell? My collection of signet&mdash;&rsquo; 
      But at the thought of scattering these loved treasures the blood leaped
      into Morris&rsquo;s check. &lsquo;I would rather die!&rsquo; he exclaimed, and, cramming his
      hat upon his head, strode forth into the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I MUST raise funds,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;My uncle being dead, the money in the
      bank is mine, or would be mine but for the cursed injustice that has
      pursued me ever since I was an orphan in a commercial academy. I know what
      any other man would do; any other man in Christendom would forge; although
      I don&rsquo;t know why I call it forging, either, when Joseph&rsquo;s dead, and the
      funds are my own. When I think of that, when I think that my uncle is
      really as dead as mutton, and that I can&rsquo;t prove it, my gorge rises at the
      injustice of the whole affair. I used to feel bitterly about that seven
      thousand eight hundred pounds; it seems a trifle now! Dear me, why, the
      day before yesterday I was comparatively happy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Morris stood on the sidewalk and heaved another sobbing sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then there&rsquo;s another thing,&rsquo; he resumed; &lsquo;can I? Am I able? Why didn&rsquo;t I
      practise different handwritings while I was young? How a fellow regrets
      those lost opportunities when he grows up! But there&rsquo;s one comfort: it&rsquo;s
      not morally wrong; I can try it on with a clear conscience, and even if I
      was found out, I wouldn&rsquo;t greatly care&mdash;morally, I mean. And then, if
      I succeed, and if Pitman is staunch, there&rsquo;s nothing to do but find a
      venal doctor; and that ought to be simple enough in a place like London.
      By all accounts the town&rsquo;s alive with them. It wouldn&rsquo;t do, of course, to
      advertise for a corrupt physician; that would be impolitic. No, I suppose
      a fellow has simply to spot along the streets for a red lamp and herbs in
      the window, and then you go in and&mdash;and&mdash;and put it to him
      plainly; though it seems a delicate step.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was near home now, after many devious wanderings, and turned up John
      Street. As he thrust his latchkey in the lock, another mortifying
      reflection struck him to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not even this house is mine till I can prove him dead,&rsquo; he snarled, and
      slammed the door behind him so that the windows in the attic rattled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night had long fallen; long ago the lamps and the shop-fronts had begun to
      glitter down the endless streets; the lobby was pitch&mdash;dark; and, as
      the devil would have it, Morris barked his shins and sprawled all his
      length over the pedestal of Hercules. The pain was sharp; his temper was
      already thoroughly undermined; by a last misfortune his hand closed on the
      hammer as he fell; and, in a spasm of childish irritation, he turned and
      struck at the offending statue. There was a splintering crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Lord, what have I done next?&rsquo; wailed Morris; and he groped his way to
      find a candle. &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he reflected, as he stood with the light in his hand
      and looked upon the mutilated leg, from which about a pound of muscle was
      detached. &lsquo;Yes, I have destroyed a genuine antique; I may be in for
      thousands!&rsquo; And then there sprung up in his bosom a sort of angry hope.
      &lsquo;Let me see,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Julia&rsquo;s got rid of&mdash;, there&rsquo;s nothing to
      connect me with that beast Forsyth; the men were all drunk, and (what&rsquo;s
      better) they&rsquo;ve been all discharged. O, come, I think this is another case
      of moral courage! I&rsquo;ll deny all knowledge of the thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment more, and he stood again before the Hercules, his lips sternly
      compressed, the coal-axe and the meat-cleaver under his arm. The next, he
      had fallen upon the packing-case. This had been already seriously
      undermined by the operations of Gideon; a few well-directed blows, and it
      already quaked and gaped; yet a few more, and it fell about Morris in a
      shower of boards followed by an avalanche of straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the leather-merchant could behold the nature of his task: and at
      the first sight his spirit quailed. It was, indeed, no more ambitious a
      task for De Lesseps, with all his men and horses, to attack the hills of
      Panama, than for a single, slim young gentleman, with no previous
      experience of labour in a quarry, to measure himself against that bloated
      monster on his pedestal. And yet the pair were well encountered: on the
      one side, bulk&mdash;on the other, genuine heroic fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down you shall come, you great big, ugly brute!&rsquo; cried Morris aloud, with
      something of that passion which swept the Parisian mob against the walls
      of the Bastille. &lsquo;Down you shall come, this night. I&rsquo;ll have none of you
      in my lobby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The face, from its indecent expression, had particularly animated the zeal
      of our iconoclast; and it was against the face that he began his
      operations. The great height of the demigod&mdash;for he stood a fathom
      and half in his stocking-feet&mdash;offered a preliminary obstacle to this
      attack. But here, in the first skirmish of the battle, intellect already
      began to triumph over matter. By means of a pair of library steps, the
      injured householder gained a posture of advantage; and, with great swipes
      of the coal-axe, proceeded to decapitate the brute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, what had been the erect image of a gigantic coal-porter
      turned miraculously white, was now no more than a medley of disjected
      members; the quadragenarian torso prone against the pedestal; the
      lascivious countenance leering down the kitchen stair; the legs, the arms,
      the hands, and even the fingers, scattered broadcast on the lobby floor.
      Half an hour more, and all the debris had been laboriously carted to the
      kitchen; and Morris, with a gentle sentiment of triumph, looked round upon
      the scene of his achievements. Yes, he could deny all knowledge of it now:
      the lobby, beyond the fact that it was partly ruinous, betrayed no trace
      of the passage of Hercules. But it was a weary Morris that crept up to
      bed; his arms and shoulders ached, the palms of his hands burned from the
      rough kisses of the coal-axe, and there was one smarting finger that stole
      continually to his mouth. Sleep long delayed to visit the dilapidated
      hero, and with the first peep of day it had again deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning, as though to accord with his disastrous fortunes, dawned
      inclemently. An easterly gale was shouting in the streets; flaws of rain
      angrily assailed the windows; and as Morris dressed, the draught from the
      fireplace vividly played about his legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think,&rsquo; he could not help observing bitterly, &lsquo;that with all I have to
      bear, they might have given me decent weather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no bread in the house, for Miss Hazeltine (like all women left
      to themselves) had subsisted entirely upon cake. But some of this was
      found, and (along with what the poets call a glass of fair, cold water)
      made up a semblance of a morning meal, and then down he sat undauntedly to
      his delicate task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more interesting than the study of signatures, written (as
      they are) before meals and after, during indigestion and intoxication;
      written when the signer is trembling for the life of his child or has come
      from winning the Derby, in his lawyer&rsquo;s office, or under the bright eyes
      of his sweetheart. To the vulgar, these seem never the same; but to the
      expert, the bank clerk, or the lithographer, they are constant quantities,
      and as recognizable as the North Star to the night-watch on deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all this Morris was alive. In the theory of that graceful art in which
      he was now embarking, our spirited leather-merchant was beyond all
      reproach. But, happily for the investor, forgery is an affair of practice.
      And as Morris sat surrounded by examples of his uncle&rsquo;s signature and of
      his own incompetence, insidious depression stole upon his spirits. From
      time to time the wind wuthered in the chimney at his back; from time to
      time there swept over Bloomsbury a squall so dark that he must rise and
      light the gas; about him was the chill and the mean disorder of a house
      out of commission&mdash;the floor bare, the sofa heaped with books and
      accounts enveloped in a dirty table-cloth, the pens rusted, the paper
      glazed with a thick film of dust; and yet these were but adminicles of
      misery, and the true root of his depression lay round him on the table in
      the shape of misbegotten forgeries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s one of the strangest things I ever heard of,&rsquo; he complained. &lsquo;It
      almost seems as if it was a talent that I didn&rsquo;t possess.&rsquo; He went once
      more minutely through his proofs. &lsquo;A clerk would simply gibe at them,&rsquo; 
      said he. &lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing else but tracing possible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till a squall had passed and there came a blink of scowling
      daylight. Then he went to the window, and in the face of all John Street
      traced his uncle&rsquo;s signature. It was a poor thing at the best. &lsquo;But it
      must do,&rsquo; said he, as he stood gazing woefully on his handiwork. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      dead, anyway.&rsquo; And he filled up the cheque for a couple of hundred and
      sallied forth for the Anglo-Patagonian Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, at the desk at which he was accustomed to transact business, and
      with as much indifference as he could assume, Morris presented the forged
      cheque to the big, red-bearded Scots teller. The teller seemed to view it
      with surprise; and as he turned it this way and that, and even scrutinized
      the signature with a magnifying-glass, his surprise appeared to warm into
      disfavour. Begging to be excused for a moment, he passed away into the
      rearmost quarters of the bank; whence, after an appreciable interval, he
      returned again in earnest talk with a superior, an oldish and a baldish,
      but a very gentlemanly man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Morris Finsbury, I believe,&rsquo; said the gentlemanly man, fixing Morris
      with a pair of double eye-glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my name,&rsquo; said Morris, quavering. &lsquo;Is there anything wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, the fact is, Mr Finsbury, you see we are rather surprised at
      receiving this,&rsquo; said the other, flicking at the cheque. &lsquo;There are no
      effects.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No effects?&rsquo; cried Morris. &lsquo;Why, I know myself there must be
      eight-and-twenty hundred pounds, if there&rsquo;s a penny.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two seven six four, I think,&rsquo; replied the gentlemanly man; &lsquo;but it was
      drawn yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drawn!&rsquo; cried Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By your uncle himself, sir,&rsquo; continued the other. &lsquo;Not only that, but we
      discounted a bill for him for&mdash;let me see&mdash;how much was it for,
      Mr Bell?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eight hundred, Mr Judkin,&rsquo; replied the teller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bent Pitman!&rsquo; cried Morris, staggering back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Mr Judkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s only an expletive,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope there&rsquo;s nothing wrong, Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; said Mr Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All I can tell you,&rsquo; said Morris, with a harsh laugh,&rsquo; is that the whole
      thing&rsquo;s impossible. My uncle is at Bournemouth, unable to move.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really!&rsquo; cried Mr Bell, and he recovered the cheque from Mr Judkin. &lsquo;But
      this cheque is dated in London, and today,&rsquo; he observed. &lsquo;How d&rsquo;ye account
      for that, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, that was a mistake,&rsquo; said Morris, and a deep tide of colour dyed his
      face and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rsquo; said Mr Judkin, but he looked at his customer
      enquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;&rsquo; resumed Morris, &lsquo;even if there were no effects&mdash;this
      is a very trifling sum to overdraw&mdash;our firm&mdash;the name of
      Finsbury, is surely good enough for such a wretched sum as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt, Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; returned Mr Judkin; &lsquo;and if you insist I will
      take it into consideration; but I hardly think&mdash;in short, Mr
      Finsbury, if there had been nothing else, the signature seems hardly all
      that we could wish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s of no consequence,&rsquo; replied Morris nervously. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get my uncle
      to sign another. The fact is,&rsquo; he went on, with a bold stroke, &lsquo;my uncle
      is so far from well at present that he was unable to sign this cheque
      without assistance, and I fear that my holding the pen for him may have
      made the difference in the signature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Judkin shot a keen glance into Morris&rsquo;s face; and then turned and
      looked at Mr Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it seems as if we had been victimized by a swindler.
      Pray tell Mr Finsbury we shall put detectives on at once. As for this
      cheque of yours, I regret that, owing to the way it was signed, the bank
      can hardly consider it&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;businesslike,&rsquo; and he
      returned the cheque across the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris took it up mechanically; he was thinking of something very
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a&mdash;case of this kind,&rsquo; he began, &lsquo;I believe the loss falls on us;
      I mean upon my uncle and myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does not, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr Bell; &lsquo;the bank is responsible, and the
      bank will either recover the money or refund it, you may depend on that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris&rsquo;s face fell; then it was visited by another gleam of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you leave this entirely in my hands. I&rsquo;ll
      sift the matter. I&rsquo;ve an idea, at any rate; and detectives,&rsquo; he added
      appealingly, &lsquo;are so expensive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bank would not hear of it,&rsquo; returned Mr Judkin. &lsquo;The bank stands to
      lose between three and four thousand pounds; it will spend as much more if
      necessary. An undiscovered forger is a permanent danger. We shall clear it
      up to the bottom, Mr Finsbury; set your mind at rest on that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stand the loss,&rsquo; said Morris boldly. &lsquo;I order you to abandon
      the search.&rsquo; He was determined that no enquiry should be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; returned Mr Judkin, &lsquo;but we have nothing to do with
      you in this matter, which is one between your uncle and ourselves. If he
      should take this opinion, and will either come here himself or let me see
      him in his sick-room&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite impossible,&rsquo; cried Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, you see,&rsquo; said Mr Judkin, &lsquo;how my hands are tied. The whole
      affair must go at once into the hands of the police.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris mechanically folded the cheque and restored it to his pocket&mdash;book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good&mdash;morning,&rsquo; said he, and scrambled somehow out of the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they suspect,&rsquo; he reflected; &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t make them out,
      their whole behaviour is thoroughly unbusinesslike. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter;
      all&rsquo;s up with everything. The money has been paid; the police are on the
      scent; in two hours that idiot Pitman will be nabbed&mdash;and the whole
      story of the dead body in the evening papers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      If he could have heard what passed in the bank after his departure he
      would have been less alarmed, perhaps more mortified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was a curious affair, Mr Bell,&rsquo; said Mr Judkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Mr Bell, &lsquo;but I think we have given him a fright.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, we shall hear no more of Mr Morris Finsbury,&rsquo; returned the other; &lsquo;it
      was a first attempt, and the house have dealt with us so long that I was
      anxious to deal gently. But I suppose, Mr Bell, there can be no mistake
      about yesterday? It was old Mr Finsbury himself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There could be no possible doubt of that,&rsquo; said Mr Bell with a chuckle.
      &lsquo;He explained to me the principles of banking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Mr Judkin. &lsquo;The next time he calls ask him to step into
      my room. It is only proper he should be warned.&rsquo;

      CHAPTER VII. In Which William Dent Pitman takes Legal Advice
    </h2>
    <p>
      Norfolk Street, King&rsquo;s Road&mdash;jocularly known among Mr Pitman&rsquo;s
      lodgers as &lsquo;Norfolk Island&rsquo;&mdash;is neither a long, a handsome, nor a
      pleasing thoroughfare. Dirty, undersized maids-of-all-work issue from it
      in pursuit of beer, or linger on its sidewalk listening to the voice of
      love. The cat&rsquo;s-meat man passes twice a day. An occasional organ-grinder
      wanders in and wanders out again, disgusted. In holiday-time the street is
      the arena of the young bloods of the neighbourhood, and the householders
      have an opportunity of studying the manly art of self-defence. And yet
      Norfolk Street has one claim to be respectable, for it contains not a
      single shop&mdash;unless you count the public-house at the corner, which
      is really in the King&rsquo;s Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of No. 7 bore a brass plate inscribed with the legend &lsquo;W. D.
      Pitman, Artist&rsquo;. It was not a particularly clean brass plate, nor was No.
      7 itself a particularly inviting place of residence. And yet it had a
      character of its own, such as may well quicken the pulse of the reader&rsquo;s
      curiosity. For here was the home of an artist&mdash;and a distinguished
      artist too, highly distinguished by his ill-success&mdash;which had never
      been made the subject of an article in the illustrated magazines. No
      wood-engraver had ever reproduced &lsquo;a corner in the back drawing-room&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;the studio mantelpiece&rsquo; of No. 7; no young lady author had ever commented
      on &lsquo;the unaffected simplicity&rsquo; with which Mr Pitman received her in the
      midst of his &lsquo;treasures&rsquo;. It is an omission I would gladly supply, but our
      business is only with the backward parts and &lsquo;abject rear&rsquo; of this
      aesthetic dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a garden, boasting a dwarf fountain (that never played) in the
      centre, a few grimy-looking flowers in pots, two or three newly planted
      trees which the spring of Chelsea visited without noticeable consequence,
      and two or three statues after the antique, representing satyrs and nymphs
      in the worst possible style of sculptured art. On one side the garden was
      overshadowed by a pair of crazy studios, usually hired out to the more
      obscure and youthful practitioners of British art. Opposite these another
      lofty out-building, somewhat more carefully finished, and boasting of a
      communication with the house and a private door on the back lane,
      enshrined the multifarious industry of Mr Pitman. All day, it is true, he
      was engaged in the work of education at a seminary for young ladies; but
      the evenings at least were his own, and these he would prolong far into
      the night, now dashing off &lsquo;A landscape with waterfall&rsquo; in oil, now a
      volunteer bust (&lsquo;in marble&rsquo;, as he would gently but proudly observe) of
      some public character, now stooping his chisel to a mere &lsquo;nymph&rsquo; for a
      gasbracket on a stair, sir&rsquo;, or a life-size &lsquo;Infant Samuel&rsquo; for a
      religious nursery. Mr Pitman had studied in Paris, and he had studied in
      Rome, supplied with funds by a fond parent who went subsequently bankrupt
      in consequence of a fall in corsets; and though he was never thought to
      have the smallest modicum of talent, it was at one time supposed that he
      had learned his business. Eighteen years of what is called &lsquo;tuition&rsquo; had
      relieved him of the dangerous knowledge. His artist lodgers would
      sometimes reason with him; they would point out to him how impossible it
      was to paint by gaslight, or to sculpture life-sized nymphs without a
      model.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that,&rsquo; he would reply. &lsquo;No one in Norfolk Street knows it better;
      and if I were rich I should certainly employ the best models in London;
      but, being poor, I have taught myself to do without them. An occasional
      model would only disturb my ideal conception of the figure, and be a
      positive impediment in my career. As for painting by an artificial light,&rsquo; 
      he would continue, &lsquo;that is simply a knack I have found it necessary to
      acquire, my days being engrossed in the work of tuition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when we must present him to our readers, Pitman was in his
      studio alone, by the dying light of the October day. He sat (sure enough
      with &lsquo;unaffected simplicity&rsquo;) in a Windsor chair, his low-crowned black
      felt hat by his side; a dark, weak, harmless, pathetic little man, clad in
      the hue of mourning, his coat longer than is usual with the laity, his
      neck enclosed in a collar without a parting, his neckcloth pale in hue and
      simply tied; the whole outward man, except for a pointed beard,
      tentatively clerical. There was a thinning on the top of Pitman&rsquo;s head,
      there were silver hairs at Pitman&rsquo;s temple. Poor gentleman, he was no
      longer young; and years, and poverty, and humble ambition thwarted, make a
      cheerless lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of him, in the corner by the door, there stood a portly barrel;
      and let him turn them where he might, it was always to the barrel that his
      eyes and his thoughts returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should I open it? Should I return it? Should I communicate with Mr
      Sernitopolis at once?&rsquo; he wondered. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he concluded finally, &lsquo;nothing
      without Mr Finsbury&rsquo;s advice.&rsquo; And he arose and produced a shabby leathern
      desk. It opened without the formality of unlocking, and displayed the
      thick cream-coloured notepaper on which Mr Pitman was in the habit of
      communicating with the proprietors of schools and the parents of his
      pupils. He placed the desk on the table by the window, and taking a saucer
      of Indian ink from the chimney-piece, laboriously composed the following
      letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; it ran, &lsquo;would it be presuming on your kindness if
      I asked you to pay me a visit here this evening? It is in no trifling
      matter that I invoke your valuable assistance, for need I say more than it
      concerns the welfare of Mr Semitopolis&rsquo;s statue of Hercules? I write you
      in great agitation of mind; for I have made all enquiries, and greatly
      fear that this work of ancient art has been mislaid. I labour besides
      under another perplexity, not unconnected with the first. Pray excuse the
      inelegance of this scrawl, and believe me yours in haste, William D.
      Pitman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with this he set forth and rang the bell of No. 233 King&rsquo;s Road, the
      private residence of Michael Finsbury. He had met the lawyer at a time of
      great public excitement in Chelsea; Michael, who had a sense of humour and
      a great deal of careless kindness in his nature, followed the acquaintance
      up, and, having come to laugh, remained to drop into a contemptuous kind
      of friendship. By this time, which was four years after the first meeting,
      Pitman was the lawyer&rsquo;s dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the elderly housekeeper, who opened the door in person, &lsquo;Mr
      Michael&rsquo;s not in yet. But ye&rsquo;re looking terribly poorly, Mr Pitman. Take a
      glass of sherry, sir, to cheer ye up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied the artist. &lsquo;It is very good in you, but
      I scarcely feel in sufficient spirits for sherry. Just give Mr Finsbury
      this note, and ask him to look round&mdash;to the door in the lane, you
      will please tell him; I shall be in the studio all evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he turned again into the street and walked slowly homeward. A
      hairdresser&rsquo;s window caught his attention, and he stared long and
      earnestly at the proud, high&mdash;born, waxen lady in evening dress, who
      circulated in the centre of the show. The artist woke in him, in spite of
      his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all very well to run down the men who make these things,&rsquo; he cried,
      &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s a something&mdash;there&rsquo;s a haughty, indefinable something
      about that figure. It&rsquo;s what I tried for in my &ldquo;Empress Eugenie&rdquo;,&rsquo; he
      added, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went home reflecting on the quality. &lsquo;They don&rsquo;t teach you that
      direct appeal in Paris,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s British. Come, I am going to
      sleep, I must wake up, I must aim higher&mdash;aim higher,&rsquo; cried the
      little artist to himself. All through his tea and afterward, as he was
      giving his eldest boy a lesson on the fiddle, his mind dwelt no longer on
      his troubles, but he was rapt into the better land; and no sooner was he
      at liberty than he hastened with positive exhilaration to his studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the sight of the barrel could entirely cast him down. He flung
      himself with rising zest into his work&mdash;a bust of Mr Gladstone from a
      photograph; turned (with extraordinary success) the difficulty of the back
      of the head, for which he had no documents beyond a hazy recollection of a
      public meeting; delighted himself by his treatment of the collar; and was
      only recalled to the cares of life by Michael Finsbury&rsquo;s rattle at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo; said Michael, advancing to the grate, where, knowing
      his friend&rsquo;s delight in a bright fire, Mr Pitman had not spared the fuel.
      &lsquo;I suppose you have come to grief somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no expression strong enough,&rsquo; said the artist. &lsquo;Mr Semitopolis&rsquo;s
      statue has not turned up, and I am afraid I shall be answerable for the
      money; but I think nothing of that&mdash;what I fear, my dear Mr Finsbury,
      what I fear&mdash;alas that I should have to say it! is exposure. The
      Hercules was to be smuggled out of Italy; a thing positively wrong, a
      thing of which a man of my principles and in my responsible position
      should have taken (as I now see too late) no part whatever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This sounds like very serious work,&rsquo; said the lawyer. &lsquo;It will require a
      great deal of drink, Pitman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took the liberty of&mdash;in short, of being prepared for you,&rsquo; replied
      the artist, pointing to a kettle, a bottle of gin, a lemon, and glasses.
      Michael mixed himself a grog, and offered the artist a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said Pitman. &lsquo;I used occasionally to be rather partial to
      it, but the smell is so disagreeable about the clothes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said the lawyer. &lsquo;I am comfortable now. Unfold your tale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At some length Pitman set forth his sorrows. He had gone today to
      Waterloo, expecting to receive the colossal Hercules, and he had received
      instead a barrel not big enough to hold Discobolus; yet the barrel was
      addressed in the hand (with which he was perfectly acquainted) of his
      Roman correspondent. What was stranger still, a case had arrived by the
      same train, large enough and heavy enough to contain the Hercules; and
      this case had been taken to an address now undiscoverable. &lsquo;The vanman (I
      regret to say it) had been drinking, and his language was such as I could
      never bring myself to repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at once discharged by the superintendent of the line, who behaved
      most properly throughout, and is to make enquiries at Southampton. In the
      meanwhile, what was I to do? I left my address and brought the barrel
      home; but, remembering an old adage, I determined not to open it except in
      the presence of my lawyer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; asked Michael. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any cause to worry. The
      Hercules has stuck upon the road. It will drop in tomorrow or the day
      after; and as for the barrel, depend upon it, it&rsquo;s a testimonial from one
      of your young ladies, and probably contains oysters.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t speak so loud!&rsquo; cried the little artist. &lsquo;It would cost me my
      place if I were heard to speak lightly of the young ladies; and besides,
      why oysters from Italy? and why should they come to me addressed in Signor
      Ricardi&rsquo;s hand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have a look at it,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s roll it forward to
      the light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men rolled the barrel from the corner, and stood it on end before
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s heavy enough to be oysters,&rsquo; remarked Michael judiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we open it at once?&rsquo; enquired the artist, who had grown decidedly
      cheerful under the combined effects of company and gin; and without
      waiting for a reply, he began to strip as if for a prize-fight, tossed his
      clerical collar in the wastepaper basket, hung his clerical coat upon a
      nail, and with a chisel in one hand and a hammer in the other, struck the
      first blow of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the style, William Dent&rsquo; cried Michael. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s fire for&mdash;your
      money! It may be a romantic visit from one of the young ladies&mdash;a
      sort of Cleopatra business. Have a care and don&rsquo;t stave in Cleopatra&rsquo;s
      head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sight of Pitman&rsquo;s alacrity was infectious. The lawyer could sit
      still no longer. Tossing his cigar into the fire, he snatched the
      instrument from the unwilling hands of the artist, and fell to himself.
      Soon the sweat stood in beads upon his large, fair brow; his stylish
      trousers were defaced with iron rust, and the state of his chisel
      testified to misdirected energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cask is not an easy thing to open, even when you set about it in the
      right way; when you set about it wrongly, the whole structure must be
      resolved into its elements. Such was the course pursued alike by the
      artist and the lawyer. Presently the last hoop had been removed&mdash;a
      couple of smart blows tumbled the staves upon the ground&mdash;and what
      had once been a barrel was no more than a confused heap of broken and
      distorted boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of these, a certain dismal something, swathed in blankets,
      remained for an instant upright, and then toppled to one side and heavily
      collapsed before the fire. Even as the thing subsided, an eye-glass
      tingled to the floor and rolled toward the screaming Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue!&rsquo; said Michael. He dashed to the house door and locked
      it; then, with a pale face and bitten lip, he drew near, pulled aside a
      corner of the swathing blanket, and recoiled, shuddering. There was a long
      silence in the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now tell me,&rsquo; said Michael, in a low voice: &lsquo;Had you any hand in it?&rsquo; and
      he pointed to the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little artist could only utter broken and disjointed sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael poured some gin into a glass. &lsquo;Drink that,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      afraid of me. I&rsquo;m your friend through thick and thin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman put the liquor down untasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I swear before God,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this is another mystery to me. In my worst
      fears I never dreamed of such a thing. I would not lay a finger on a
      sucking infant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all square,&rsquo; said Michael, with a sigh of huge relief. &lsquo;I believe
      you, old boy.&rsquo; And he shook the artist warmly by the hand. &lsquo;I thought for
      a moment,&rsquo; he added with rather a ghastly smile, &lsquo;I thought for a moment
      you might have made away with Mr Semitopolis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would make no difference if I had,&rsquo; groaned Pitman. &lsquo;All is at an end
      for me. There&rsquo;s the writing on the wall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To begin with,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s get him out of sight; for to be
      quite plain with you, Pitman, I don&rsquo;t like your friend&rsquo;s appearance.&rsquo; And
      with that the lawyer shuddered. &lsquo;Where can we put it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You might put it in the closet there&mdash;if you could bear to touch
      it,&rsquo; answered the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody has to do it, Pitman,&rsquo; returned the lawyer; &lsquo;and it seems as if
      it had to be me. You go over to the table, turn your back, and mix me a
      grog; that&rsquo;s a fair division of labour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      About ninety seconds later the closet-door was heard to shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; observed Michael, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s more homelike. You can turn now, my
      pallid Pitman. Is this the grog?&rsquo; he ran on. &lsquo;Heaven forgive you, it&rsquo;s a
      lemonade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, O, Finsbury, what are we to do with it?&rsquo; walled the artist, laying a
      clutching hand upon the lawyer&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do with it?&rsquo; repeated Michael. &lsquo;Bury it in one of your flowerbeds, and
      erect one of your own statues for a monument. I tell you we should look
      devilish romantic shovelling out the sod by the moon&rsquo;s pale ray. Here, put
      some gin in this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg of you, Mr Finsbury, do not trifle with my misery,&rsquo; cried Pitman.
      &lsquo;You see before you a man who has been all his life&mdash;I do not
      hesitate to say it&mdash;imminently respectable. Even in this solemn hour
      I can lay my hand upon my heart without a blush. Except on the really
      trifling point of the smuggling of the Hercules (and even of that I now
      humbly repent), my life has been entirely fit for publication. I never
      feared the light,&rsquo; cried the little man; &lsquo;and now&mdash;now&mdash;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheer up, old boy,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;I assure you we should count this
      little contretemps a trifle at the office; it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that may
      occur to any one; and if you&rsquo;re perfectly sure you had no hand in it&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What language am I to find&mdash;&rsquo; began Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I&rsquo;ll do that part of it,&rsquo; interrupted Michael, &lsquo;you have no
      experience.&rsquo; But the point is this: If&mdash;or rather since&mdash;you
      know nothing of the crime, since the&mdash;the party in the closet&mdash;is
      neither your father, nor your brother, nor your creditor, nor your
      mother-in-law, nor what they call an injured husband&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, my dear sir!&rsquo; interjected Pitman, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since, in short,&rsquo; continued the lawyer, &lsquo;you had no possible interest in
      the crime, we have a perfectly free field before us and a safe game to
      play. Indeed, the problem is really entertaining; it is one I have long
      contemplated in the light of an A. B. case; here it is at last under my
      hand in specie; and I mean to pull you through. Do you hear that?&mdash;I
      mean to pull you through. Let me see: it&rsquo;s a long time since I have had
      what I call a genuine holiday; I&rsquo;ll send an excuse tomorrow to the office.
      We had best be lively,&rsquo; he added significantly; &lsquo;for we must not spoil the
      market for the other man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; enquired Pitman. &lsquo;What other man? The inspector of
      police?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn the inspector of police!&rsquo; remarked his companion. &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t take
      the short cut and bury this in your back garden, we must find some one who
      will bury it in his. We must place the affair, in short, in the hands of
      some one with fewer scruples and more resources.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A private detective, perhaps?&rsquo; suggested Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are times when you fill me with pity,&rsquo; observed the lawyer. &lsquo;By the
      way, Pitman,&rsquo; he added in another key, &lsquo;I have always regretted that you
      have no piano in this den of yours. Even if you don&rsquo;t play yourself, your
      friends might like to entertain themselves with a little music while you
      were mudding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall get one at once if you like,&rsquo; said Pitman nervously, anxious to
      please. &lsquo;I play the fiddle a little as it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you do,&rsquo; said Michael; &lsquo;but what&rsquo;s the fiddle&mdash;above all as
      you play it? What you want is polyphonic music. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what it
      is&mdash;since it&rsquo;s too late for you to buy a piano I&rsquo;ll give you mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said the artist blankly. &lsquo;You will give me yours? I am sure
      it&rsquo;s very good in you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll give you mine,&rsquo; continued Michael, &lsquo;for the inspector of police
      to play on while his men are digging up your back garden.&rsquo; Pitman stared
      at him in pained amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not insane,&rsquo; Michael went on. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m playful, but quite coherent.
      See here, Pitman: follow me one half minute. I mean to profit by the
      refreshing fact that we are really and truly innocent; nothing but the
      presence of the&mdash;you know what&mdash;connects us with the crime; once
      let us get rid of it, no matter how, and there is no possible clue to
      trace us by. Well, I give you my piano; we&rsquo;ll bring it round this very
      night. Tomorrow we rip the fittings out, deposit the&mdash;our friend&mdash;inside,
      plump the whole on a cart, and carry it to the chambers of a young
      gentleman whom I know by sight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whom do you know by sight?&rsquo; repeated Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is more to the purpose,&rsquo; continued Michael, &lsquo;whose chambers I
      know better than he does himself. A friend of mine&mdash;I call him my
      friend for brevity; he is now, I understand, in Demerara and (most likely)
      in gaol&mdash;was the previous occupant. I defended him, and I got him off
      too&mdash;all saved but honour; his assets were nil, but he gave me what
      he had, poor gentleman, and along with the rest&mdash;the key of his
      chambers. It&rsquo;s there that I propose to leave the piano and, shall we say,
      Cleopatra?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems very wild,&rsquo; said Pitman. &lsquo;And what will become of the poor young
      gentleman whom you know by sight?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will do him good,&rsquo;&mdash;said Michael cheerily. &lsquo;Just what he wants to
      steady him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear sir, he might be involved in a charge of&mdash;a charge of
      murder,&rsquo; gulped the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll be just where we are,&rsquo; returned the lawyer. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s innocent,
      you see. What hangs people, my dear Pitman, is the unfortunate
      circumstance of guilt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But indeed, indeed,&rsquo; pleaded Pitman, &lsquo;the whole scheme appears to me so
      wild. Would it not be safer, after all, just to send for the police?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And make a scandal?&rsquo; enquired Michael. &lsquo;&ldquo;The Chelsea Mystery; alleged
      innocence of Pitman&rdquo;? How would that do at the Seminary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would imply my discharge,&rsquo; admitted the drawing&mdash;master. &lsquo;I
      cannot deny that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And besides,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;I am not going to embark in such a business
      and have no fun for my money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O my dear sir, is that a proper spirit?&rsquo; cried Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I only said that to cheer you up,&rsquo; said the unabashed Michael.
      &lsquo;Nothing like a little judicious levity. But it&rsquo;s quite needless to
      discuss. If you mean to follow my advice, come on, and let us get the
      piano at once. If you don&rsquo;t, just drop me the word, and I&rsquo;ll leave you to
      deal with the whole thing according to your better judgement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know perfectly well that I depend on you entirely,&rsquo; returned Pitman.
      &lsquo;But O, what a night is before me with that&mdash;horror in my studio! How
      am I to think of it on my pillow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you know, my piano will be there too,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll raise
      the average.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later a cart came up the lane, and the lawyer&rsquo;s piano&mdash;a
      momentous Broadwood grand&mdash;was deposited in Mr Pitman&rsquo;s studio.

      CHAPTER VIII. In Which Michael Finsbury Enjoys a Holiday
    </h2>
    <p>
      Punctually at eight o&rsquo;clock next morning the lawyer rattled (according to
      previous appointment) on the studio door. He found the artist sadly
      altered for the worse&mdash;bleached, bloodshot, and chalky&mdash;a man
      upon wires, the tail of his haggard eye still wandering to the closet. Nor
      was the professor of drawing less inclined to wonder at his friend.
      Michael was usually attired in the height of fashion, with a certain
      mercantile brilliancy best described perhaps as stylish; nor could
      anything be said against him, as a rule, but that he looked a trifle too
      like a wedding guest to be quite a gentleman. Today he had fallen
      altogether from these heights. He wore a flannel shirt of washed-out
      shepherd&rsquo;s tartan, and a suit of reddish tweeds, of the colour known to
      tailors as &lsquo;heather mixture&rsquo;; his neckcloth was black, and tied loosely in
      a sailor&rsquo;s knot; a rusty ulster partly concealed these advantages; and his
      feet were shod with rough walking boots. His hat was an old soft felt,
      which he removed with a flourish as he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I am, William Dent!&rsquo; he cried, and drawing from his pocket two
      little wisps of reddish hair, he held them to his cheeks like sidewhiskers
      and danced about the studio with the filmy graces of a ballet-girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman laughed sadly. &lsquo;I should never have known you,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor were you intended to,&rsquo; returned Michael, replacing his false whiskers
      in his pocket. &lsquo;Now we must overhaul you and your wardrobe, and disguise
      you up to the nines.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disguise!&rsquo; cried the artist. &lsquo;Must I indeed disguise myself. Has it come
      to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear creature,&rsquo; returned his companion, &lsquo;disguise is the spice of
      life. What is life, passionately exclaimed a French philosopher, without
      the pleasures of disguise? I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s always good taste, and I know
      it&rsquo;s unprofessional; but what&rsquo;s the odds, downhearted drawing-master? It
      has to be. We have to leave a false impression on the minds of many
      persons, and in particular on the mind of Mr Gideon Forsyth&mdash;the
      young gentleman I know by sight&mdash;if he should have the bad taste to
      be at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he be at home?&rsquo; faltered the artist. &lsquo;That would be the end of all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t matter a d&mdash;,&rsquo; returned Michael airily. &lsquo;Let me see your
      clothes, and I&rsquo;ll make a new man of you in a jiffy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bedroom, to which he was at once conducted, Michael examined
      Pitman&rsquo;s poor and scanty wardrobe with a humorous eye, picked out a short
      jacket of black alpaca, and presently added to that a pair of summer
      trousers which somehow took his fancy as incongruous. Then, with the
      garments in his hand, he scrutinized the artist closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like that clerical collar,&rsquo; he remarked. &lsquo;Have you nothing else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor of drawing pondered for a moment, and then brightened; &lsquo;I
      have a pair of low-necked shirts,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that I used to wear in Paris
      as a student. They are rather loud.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very thing!&rsquo; ejaculated Michael. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll look perfectly beastly. Here
      are spats, too,&rsquo; he continued, drawing forth a pair of those offensive
      little gaiters. &lsquo;Must have spats! And now you jump into these, and whistle
      a tune at the window for (say) three-quarters of an hour. After that you
      can rejoin me on the field of glory.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Michael returned to the studio. It was the morning of the
      easterly gale; the wind blew shrilly among the statues in the garden, and
      drove the rain upon the skylight in the studio ceiling; and at about the
      same moment of the time when Morris attacked the hundredth version of his
      uncle&rsquo;s signature in Bloomsbury, Michael, in Chelsea, began to rip the
      wires out of the Broadwood grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three-quarters of an hour later Pitman was admitted, to find the
      closet-door standing open, the closet untenanted, and the piano discreetly
      shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a remarkably heavy instrument,&rsquo; observed Michael, and turned to
      consider his friend&rsquo;s disguise. &lsquo;You must shave off that beard of yours,&rsquo; 
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My beard!&rsquo; cried Pitman. &lsquo;I cannot shave my beard. I cannot tamper with
      my appearance&mdash;my principals would object. They hold very strong
      views as to the appearance of the professors&mdash;young ladies are
      considered so romantic. My beard was regarded as quite a feature when I
      went about the place. It was regarded,&rsquo; said the artist, with rising
      colour, &lsquo;it was regarded as unbecoming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can let it grow again,&rsquo; returned Michael, &lsquo;and then you&rsquo;ll be so
      precious ugly that they&rsquo;ll raise your salary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be ugly,&rsquo; cried the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass,&rsquo; said Michael, who hated beards and was delighted to
      destroy one. &lsquo;Off with it like a man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, if you insist,&rsquo; said Pitman; and then he sighed, fetched some
      hot water from the kitchen, and setting a glass upon his easel, first
      clipped his beard with scissors and then shaved his chin. He could not
      conceal from himself, as he regarded the result, that his last claims to
      manhood had been sacrificed, but Michael seemed delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A new man, I declare!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;When I give you the windowglass
      spectacles I have in my pocket, you&rsquo;ll be the beau-ideal of a French
      commercial traveller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman did not reply, but continued to gaze disconsolately on his image in
      the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; asked Michael, &lsquo;what the Governor of South Carolina said to
      the Governor of North Carolina? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time between drinks,&rdquo;
       observed that powerful thinker; and if you will put your hand into the top
      left-hand pocket of my ulster, I have an impression you will find a flask
      of brandy. Thank you, Pitman,&rsquo; he added, as he filled out a glass for
      each. &lsquo;Now you will give me news of this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist reached out his hand for the water-jug, but Michael arrested
      the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if you went upon your knees!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;This is the finest liqueur
      brandy in Great Britain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman put his lips to it, set it down again, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I must say you&rsquo;re the poorest companion for a holiday!&rsquo; cried
      Michael. &lsquo;If that&rsquo;s all you know of brandy, you shall have no more of it;
      and while I finish the flask, you may as well begin business. Come to
      think of it,&rsquo; he broke off, &lsquo;I have made an abominable error: you should
      have ordered the cart before you were disguised. Why, Pitman, what the
      devil&rsquo;s the use of you? why couldn&rsquo;t you have reminded me of that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never even knew there was a cart to be ordered,&rsquo; said the artist. &lsquo;But
      I can take off the disguise again,&rsquo; he suggested eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would find it rather a bother to put on your beard,&rsquo; observed the
      lawyer. &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s a false step; the sort of thing that hangs people,&rsquo; he
      continued, with eminent cheerfulness, as he sipped his brandy; &lsquo;and it
      can&rsquo;t be retraced now. Off to the mews with you, make all the
      arrangements; they&rsquo;re to take the piano from here, cart it to Victoria,
      and dispatch it thence by rail to Cannon Street, to lie till called for in
      the name of Fortune du Boisgobey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather an awkward name?&rsquo; pleaded Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Awkward?&rsquo; cried Michael scornfully. &lsquo;It would hang us both! Brown is both
      safer and easier to pronounce. Call it Brown.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said Pitman, &lsquo;for my sake, I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t talk so much of
      hanging.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Talking about it&rsquo;s nothing, my boy!&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;But take your hat
      and be off, and mind and pay everything beforehand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, the lawyer turned his attention for some time exclusively
      to the liqueur brandy, and his spirits, which had been pretty fair all
      morning, now prodigiously rose. He proceeded to adjust his whiskers
      finally before the glass. &lsquo;Devilish rich,&rsquo; he remarked, as he contemplated
      his reflection. &lsquo;I look like a purser&rsquo;s mate.&rsquo; And at that moment the
      window-glass spectacles (which he had hitherto destined for Pitman)
      flashed into his mind; he put them on, and fell in love with the effect.
      &lsquo;Just what I required,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I wonder what I look like now? A
      humorous novelist, I should think,&rsquo; and he began to practise divers
      characters of walk, naming them to himself as&mdash;he proceeded. &lsquo;Walk of
      a humorous novelist&mdash;but that would require an umbrella. Walk of a
      purser&rsquo;s mate. Walk of an Australian colonist revisiting the scenes of
      childhood. Walk of Sepoy colonel, ditto, ditto. And in the midst of the
      Sepoy colonel (which was an excellent assumption, although inconsistent
      with the style of his make-up), his eye lighted on the piano. This
      instrument was made to lock both at the top and at the keyboard, but the
      key of the latter had been mislaid. Michael opened it and ran his fingers
      over the dumb keys. &lsquo;Fine instrument&mdash;full, rich tone,&rsquo; he observed,
      and he drew in a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr Pitman returned to the studio, he was appalled to observe his
      guide, philosopher, and friend performing miracles of execution on the
      silent grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven help me!&rsquo; thought the little man, &lsquo;I fear he has been drinking! Mr
      Finsbury,&rsquo; he said aloud; and Michael, without rising, turned upon him a
      countenance somewhat flushed, encircled with the bush of the red whiskers,
      and bestridden by the spectacles. &lsquo;Capriccio in B-flat on the departure of
      a friend,&rsquo; said he, continuing his noiseless evolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indignation awoke in the mind of Pitman. &lsquo;Those spectacles were to be
      mine,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;They are an essential part of my disguise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to wear them myself,&rsquo; replied Michael; and he added, with some
      show of truth, &lsquo;There would be a devil of a lot of suspicion aroused if we
      both wore spectacles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, well,&rsquo; said the assenting Pitman, &lsquo;I rather counted on them; but of
      course, if you insist. And at any rate, here is the cart at the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While the men were at work, Michael concealed himself in the closet among
      the debris of the barrel and the wires of the piano; and as soon as the
      coast was clear the pair sallied forth by the lane, jumped into a hansom
      in the King&rsquo;s Road, and were driven rapidly toward town. It was still cold
      and raw and boisterous; the rain beat strongly in their faces, but Michael
      refused to have the glass let down; he had now suddenly donned the
      character of cicerone, and pointed out and lucidly commented on the sights
      of London, as they drove. &lsquo;My dear fellow,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t seem to
      know anything of your native city. Suppose we visited the Tower? No? Well,
      perhaps it&rsquo;s a trifle out of our way. But, anyway&mdash;Here, cabby, drive
      round by Trafalgar Square!&rsquo; And on that historic battlefield he insisted
      on drawing up, while he criticized the statues and gave the artist many
      curious details (quite new to history) of the lives of the celebrated men
      they represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to express what Pitman suffered in the cab: cold,
      wet, terror in the capital degree, a grounded distrust of the commander
      under whom he served, a sense of imprudency in the matter of the
      low-necked shirt, a bitter sense of the decline and fall involved in the
      deprivation of his beard, all these were among the ingredients of the
      bowl. To reach the restaurant, for which they were deviously steering, was
      the first relief. To hear Michael bespeak a private room was a second and
      a still greater. Nor, as they mounted the stair under the guidance of an
      unintelligible alien, did he fail to note with gratitude the fewness of
      the persons present, or the still more cheering fact that the greater part
      of these were exiles from the land of France. It was thus a blessed
      thought that none of them would be connected with the Seminary; for even
      the French professor, though admittedly a Papist, he could scarce imagine
      frequenting so rakish an establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The alien introduced them into a small bare room with a single table, a
      sofa, and a dwarfish fire; and Michael called promptly for more coals and
      a couple of brandies and sodas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, no,&rsquo; said Pitman, &lsquo;surely not&mdash;no more to drink.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you would be at,&rsquo; said Michael plaintively. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      positively necessary to do something; and one shouldn&rsquo;t smoke before meals. I thought that was understood. You seem to have no idea of hygiene.&rsquo; And
      he compared his watch with the clock upon the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman fell into bitter musing; here he was, ridiculously shorn, absurdly
      disguised, in the company of a drunken man in spectacles, and waiting for
      a champagne luncheon in a restaurant painfully foreign. What would his
      principals think, if they could see him? What if they knew his tragic and
      deceitful errand?
    </p>
    <p>
      From these reflections he was aroused by the entrance of the alien with
      the brandies and sodas. Michael took one and bade the waiter pass the
      other to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman waved it from him with his hand. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me lose all
      self-respect,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything to oblige a friend,&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to
      drink alone. Here,&rsquo; he added to the waiter, &lsquo;you take it.&rsquo; And, then,
      touching glasses, &lsquo;The health of Mr Gideon Forsyth,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meestare Gidden Borsye,&rsquo; replied the waiter, and he tossed off the liquor
      in four gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have another?&rsquo; said Michael, with undisguised interest. &lsquo;I never saw a
      man drink faster. It restores one&rsquo;s confidence in the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the waiter excused himself politely, and, assisted by some one from
      without, began to bring in lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael made an excellent meal, which he washed down with a bottle of
      Heidsieck&rsquo;s dry monopole. As for the artist, he was far too uneasy to eat,
      and his companion flatly refused to let him share in the champagne unless
      he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of us must stay sober,&rsquo; remarked the lawyer, &lsquo;and I won&rsquo;t give you
      champagne on the strength of a leg of grouse. I have to be cautious,&rsquo; he
      added confidentially. &lsquo;One drunken man, excellent business&mdash;two
      drunken men, all my eye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the production of coffee and departure of the waiter, Michael might
      have been observed to make portentous efforts after gravity of mien. He
      looked his friend in the face (one eye perhaps a trifle off), and
      addressed him thickly but severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enough of this fooling,&rsquo; was his not inappropriate exordium. &lsquo;To
      business. Mark me closely. I am an Australian. My name is John Dickson,
      though you mightn&rsquo;t think it from my unassuming appearance. You will be
      relieved to hear that I am rich, sir, very rich. You can&rsquo;t go into this
      sort of thing too thoroughly, Pitman; the whole secret is preparation, and
      I can get up my biography from the beginning, and I could tell it you now,
      only I have forgotten it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m stupid&mdash;&rsquo; began Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; cried Michael. &lsquo;Very stupid; but rich too&mdash;richer than I
      am. I thought you would enjoy it, Pitman, so I&rsquo;ve arranged that you were
      to be literally wallowing in wealth. But then, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re
      only an American, and a maker of india-rubber overshoes at that. And the
      worst of it is&mdash;why should I conceal it from you?&mdash;the worst of
      it is that you&rsquo;re called Ezra Thomas. Now,&rsquo; said Michael, with a really
      appalling seriousness of manner, &lsquo;tell me who we are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate little man was cross-examined till he knew these facts by
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; cried the lawyer. &lsquo;Our plans are laid. Thoroughly consistent&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      the great thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand,&rsquo; objected Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, you&rsquo;ll understand right enough when it comes to the point,&rsquo; said
      Michael, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem any story to it,&rsquo; said the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can invent one as we go along,&rsquo; returned the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t invent,&rsquo; protested Pitman. &lsquo;I never could invent in all my
      life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ll have to, my boy,&rsquo; was Michael&rsquo;s easy comment, and he
      began calling for the waiter, with whom he at once resumed a sparkling
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a downcast little man that followed him. &lsquo;Of course he is very
      clever, but can I trust him in such a state?&rsquo; he asked himself. And when
      they were once more in a hansom, he took heart of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rsquo; he faltered, &lsquo;it would be wiser, considering all
      things, to put this business off?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put off till tomorrow what can be done today?&rsquo; cried Michael, with
      indignation. &lsquo;Never heard of such a thing! Cheer up, it&rsquo;s all right, go in
      and win&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lion-hearted Pitman!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cannon Street they enquired for Mr Brown&rsquo;s piano, which had duly
      arrived, drove thence to a neighbouring mews, where they contracted for a
      cart, and while that was being got ready, took shelter in the harness-room
      beside the stove. Here the lawyer presently toppled against the wall and
      fell into a gentle slumber; so that Pitman found himself launched on his
      own resources in the midst of several staring loafers, such as love to
      spend unprofitable days about a stable. &lsquo;Rough day, sir,&rsquo; observed one.
      &lsquo;Do you go far?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a&mdash;rather a rough day,&rsquo; said the artist; and then, feeling
      that he must change the conversation, &lsquo;My friend is an Australian; he is
      very impulsive,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An Australian?&rsquo; said another. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a brother myself in Melbourne. Does
      your friend come from that way at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not exactly,&rsquo; replied the artist, whose ideas of the geography of New
      Holland were a little scattered. &lsquo;He lives immensely far inland, and is
      very rich.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The loafers gazed with great respect upon the slumbering colonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; remarked the second speaker, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a mighty big place, is
      Australia. Do you come from thereaway too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I do not,&rsquo; said Pitman. &lsquo;I do not, and I don&rsquo;t want to,&rsquo; he added
      irritably. And then, feeling some diversion needful, he fell upon Michael
      and shook him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo,&rsquo; said the lawyer, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The cart is nearly ready,&rsquo; said Pitman sternly. &lsquo;I will not allow you to
      sleep.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right&mdash;no offence, old man,&rsquo; replied Michael, yawning. &lsquo;A little
      sleep never did anybody any harm; I feel comparatively sober now. But
      what&rsquo;s all the hurry?&rsquo; he added, looking round him glassily. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see
      the cart, and I&rsquo;ve forgotten where we left the piano.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      What more the lawyer might have said, in the confidence of the moment, is
      with Pitman a matter of tremulous conjecture to this day; but by the most
      blessed circumstance the cart was then announced, and Michael must bend
      the forces of his mind to the more difficult task of rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll drive,&rsquo; he remarked to his companion, as he clambered on
      the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I drive!&rsquo; cried Pitman. &lsquo;I never did such a thing in my life. I cannot
      drive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; responded Michael with entire composure, &lsquo;neither can I see.
      But just as you like. Anything to oblige a friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A glimpse of the ostler&rsquo;s darkening countenance decided Pitman. &lsquo;All
      right,&rsquo; he said desperately, &lsquo;you drive. I&rsquo;ll tell you where to go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On Michael in the character of charioteer (since this is not intended to
      be a novel of adventure) it would be superfluous to dwell at length.
      Pitman, as he sat holding on and gasping counsels, sole witness of this
      singular feat, knew not whether most to admire the driver&rsquo;s valour or his
      undeserved good fortune. But the latter at least prevailed, the cart
      reached Cannon Street without disaster; and Mr Brown&rsquo;s piano was speedily
      and cleverly got on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, sir,&rsquo; said the leading porter, smiling as he mentally reckoned up a
      handful of loose silver, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s a mortal heavy piano.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the richness of the tone,&rsquo; returned Michael, as he drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a little distance in the rain, which now fell thick and quiet,
      to the neighbourhood of Mr Gideon Forsyth&rsquo;s chambers in the Temple. There,
      in a deserted by-street, Michael drew up the horses and gave them in
      charge to a blighted shoe-black; and the pair descending from the cart,
      whereon they had figured so incongruously, set forth on foot for the
      decisive scene of their adventure. For the first time Michael displayed a
      shadow of uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are my whiskers right?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;It would be the devil and all if I was
      spotted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are perfectly in their place,&rsquo; returned Pitman, with scant
      attention. &lsquo;But is my disguise equally effective? There is nothing more
      likely than that I should meet some of my patrons.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, nobody could tell you without your beard,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;All you have
      to do is to remember to speak slow; you speak through your nose already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only hope the young man won&rsquo;t be at home,&rsquo; sighed Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I only hope he&rsquo;ll be alone,&rsquo; returned the lawyer. &lsquo;It will save a
      precious sight of manoeuvring.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And sure enough, when they had knocked at the door, Gideon admitted them
      in person to a room, warmed by a moderate fire, framed nearly to the roof
      in works connected with the bench of British Themis, and offering, except
      in one particular, eloquent testimony to the legal zeal of the proprietor.
      The one particular was the chimney-piece, which displayed a varied
      assortment of pipes, tobacco, cigar-boxes, and yellow-backed French
      novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Forsyth, I believe?&rsquo; It was Michael who thus opened the engagement.
      &lsquo;We have come to trouble you with a piece of business. I fear it&rsquo;s
      scarcely professional&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am afraid I ought to be instructed through a solicitor,&rsquo; replied
      Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, you shall name your own, and the whole affair can be put on a
      more regular footing tomorrow,&rsquo; replied Michael, taking a chair and
      motioning Pitman to do the same. &lsquo;But you see we didn&rsquo;t know any
      solicitors; we did happen to know of you, and time presses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I enquire, gentlemen,&rsquo; asked Gideon, &lsquo;to whom it was I am indebted
      for a recommendation?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may enquire,&rsquo; returned the lawyer, with a foolish laugh; &lsquo;but I was
      invited not to tell you&mdash;till the thing was done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My uncle, no doubt,&rsquo; was the barrister&rsquo;s conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is John Dickson,&rsquo; continued Michael; &lsquo;a pretty well-known name in
      Ballarat; and my friend here is Mr Ezra Thomas, of the United States of
      America, a wealthy manufacturer of india-rubber overshoes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop one moment till I make a note of that,&rsquo; said Gideon; any one might
      have supposed he was an old practitioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my smoking a cigar?&rsquo; asked Michael. He had
      pulled himself together for the entrance; now again there began to settle
      on his mind clouds of irresponsible humour and incipient slumber; and he
      hoped (as so many have hoped in the like case) that a cigar would clear
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, certainly,&rsquo; cried Gideon blandly. &lsquo;Try one of mine; I can confidently
      recommend them.&rsquo; And he handed the box to his client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In case I don&rsquo;t make myself perfectly clear,&rsquo; observed the Australian,
      &lsquo;it&rsquo;s perhaps best to tell you candidly that I&rsquo;ve been lunching. It&rsquo;s a
      thing that may happen to any one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, certainly,&rsquo; replied the affable barrister. &lsquo;But please be under no
      sense of hurry. I can give you,&rsquo; he added, thoughtfully consulting his
      watch&mdash;&lsquo;yes, I can give you the whole afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The business that brings me here,&rsquo; resumed the Australian with gusto, &lsquo;is
      devilish delicate, I can tell you. My friend Mr Thomas, being an American
      of Portuguese extraction, unacquainted with our habits, and a wealthy
      manufacturer of Broadwood pianos&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Broadwood pianos?&rsquo; cried Gideon, with some surprise. &lsquo;Dear me, do I
      understand Mr Thomas to be a member of the firm?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, pirated Broadwoods,&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;My friend&rsquo;s the American
      Broadwood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I understood you to say,&rsquo; objected Gideon, &lsquo;I certainly have it so in
      my notes&mdash;that your friend was a manufacturer of india&mdash;rubber
      overshoes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it&rsquo;s confusing at first,&rsquo; said the Australian, with a beaming
      smile. &lsquo;But he&mdash;in short, he combines the two professions. And many
      others besides&mdash;many, many, many others,&rsquo; repeated Mr Dickson, with
      drunken solemnity. &lsquo;Mr Thomas&rsquo;s cotton-mills are one of the sights of
      Tallahassee; Mr Thomas&rsquo;s tobacco-mills are the pride of Richmond, Va.; in
      short, he&rsquo;s one of my oldest friends, Mr Forsyth, and I lay his case
      before you with emotion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrister looked at Mr Thomas and was agreeably prepossessed by his
      open although nervous countenance, and the simplicity and timidity of his
      manner. &lsquo;What a people are these Americans!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Look at this
      nervous, weedy, simple little bird in a lownecked shirt, and think of him
      wielding and directing interests so extended and seemingly incongruous!
      &lsquo;But had we not better,&rsquo; he observed aloud, &lsquo;had we not perhaps better
      approach the facts?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Man of business, I perceive, sir!&rsquo; said the Australian. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s approach
      the facts. It&rsquo;s a breach of promise case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The unhappy artist was so unprepared for this view of his position that he
      could scarce suppress a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Gideon, &lsquo;they are apt to be very troublesome. Tell me
      everything about it,&rsquo; he added kindly; &lsquo;if you require my assistance,
      conceal nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You tell him,&rsquo; said Michael, feeling, apparently, that he had done his
      share. &lsquo;My friend will tell you all about it,&rsquo; he added to Gideon, with a
      yawn. &lsquo;Excuse my closing my eyes a moment; I&rsquo;ve been sitting up with a
      sick friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman gazed blankly about the room; rage and despair seethed in his
      innocent spirit; thoughts of flight, thoughts even of suicide, came and
      went before him; and still the barrister patiently waited, and still the
      artist groped in vain for any form of words, however insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a breach of promise case,&rsquo; he said at last, in a low voice. &lsquo;I&mdash;I
      am threatened with a breach of promise case.&rsquo; Here, in desperate quest of
      inspiration, he made a clutch at his beard; his fingers closed upon the
      unfamiliar smoothness of a shaven chin; and with that, hope and courage
      (if such expressions could ever have been appropriate in the case of
      Pitman) conjointly fled. He shook Michael roughly. &lsquo;Wake up!&rsquo; he cried,
      with genuine irritation in his tones. &lsquo;I cannot do it, and you know I
      can&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must excuse my friend,&rsquo; said Michael; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s no hand as a narrator of
      stirring incident. The case is simple,&rsquo; he went on. &lsquo;My friend is a man of
      very strong passions, and accustomed to a simple, patriarchal style of
      life. You see the thing from here: unfortunate visit to Europe, followed
      by unfortunate acquaintance with sham foreign count, who has a lovely
      daughter. Mr Thomas was quite carried away; he proposed, he was accepted,
      and he wrote&mdash;wrote in a style which I am sure he must regret today.
      If these letters are produced in court, sir, Mr Thomas&rsquo;s character is
      gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I to understand&mdash;&rsquo; began Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear sir,&rsquo; said the Australian emphatically, &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t possible to
      understand unless you saw them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a painful circumstance,&rsquo; said Gideon; he glanced pityingly in the
      direction of the culprit, and, observing on his countenance every mark of
      confusion, pityingly withdrew his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that would be nothing,&rsquo; continued Mr Dickson sternly, &lsquo;but I wish&mdash;I
      wish from my heart, sir, I could say that Mr Thomas&rsquo;s hands were clean. He
      has no excuse; for he was engaged at the time&mdash;and is still engaged&mdash;to
      the belle of Constantinople, Ga. My friend&rsquo;s conduct was unworthy of the
      brutes that perish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ga.?&rsquo; repeated Gideon enquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A contraction in current use,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;Ga. for Georgia, in The
      same way as Co. for Company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was aware it was sometimes so written,&rsquo; returned the barrister, &lsquo;but
      not that it was so pronounced.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fact, I assure you,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;You now see for yourself, sir, that
      if this unhappy person is to be saved, some devilish sharp practice will
      be needed. There&rsquo;s money, and no desire to spare it. Mr Thomas could write
      a cheque tomorrow for a hundred thousand. And, Mr Forsyth, there&rsquo;s better
      than money. The foreign count&mdash;Count Tarnow, he calls himself&mdash;was
      formerly a tobacconist in Bayswater, and passed under the humble but
      expressive name of Schmidt; his daughter&mdash;if she is his daughter&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      another point&mdash;make a note of that, Mr Forsyth&mdash;his daughter at
      that time actually served in the shop&mdash;and she now proposes to marry
      a man of the eminence of Mr Thomas! Now do you see our game? We know they
      contemplate a move; and we wish to forestall &lsquo;em. Down you go to Hampton
      Court, where they live, and threaten, or bribe, or both, until you get the
      letters; if you can&rsquo;t, God help us, we must go to court and Thomas must be
      exposed. I&rsquo;ll be done with him for one,&rsquo; added the unchivalrous friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There seem some elements of success,&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;Was Schmidt at all
      known to the police?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We hope so,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;We have every ground to think so. Mark the
      neighbourhood&mdash;Bayswater! Doesn&rsquo;t Bayswater occur to you as very
      suggestive?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For perhaps the sixth time during this remarkable interview, Gideon
      wondered if he were not becoming light-headed. &lsquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s just
      because he has been lunching,&rsquo; he thought; and then added aloud, &lsquo;To what
      figure may I go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps five thousand would be enough for today,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;And now,
      sir, do not let me detain you any longer; the afternoon wears on; there
      are plenty of trains to Hampton Court; and I needn&rsquo;t try to describe to
      you the impatience of my friend. Here is a five-pound note for current
      expenses; and here is the address.&rsquo; And Michael began to write, paused,
      tore up the paper, and put the pieces in his pocket. &lsquo;I will dictate,&rsquo; he
      said, &lsquo;my writing is so uncertain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon took down the address, &lsquo;Count Tarnow, Kurnaul Villa, Hampton
      Court.&rsquo; Then he wrote something else on a sheet of paper. &lsquo;You said you
      had not chosen a solicitor,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;For a case of this sort, here is
      the best man in London.&rsquo; And he handed the paper to Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God bless me!&rsquo; ejaculated Michael, as he read his own address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I daresay you have seen his name connected with some rather painful
      cases,&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;But he is himself a perfectly honest man, and his
      capacity is recognized. And now, gentlemen, it only remains for me to ask
      where I shall communicate with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Langham, of course,&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;Till tonight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Till tonight,&rsquo; replied Gideon, smiling. &lsquo;I suppose I may knock you up at
      a late hour?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any hour, any hour,&rsquo; cried the vanishing solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now there&rsquo;s a young fellow with a head upon his shoulders,&rsquo; he said to
      Pitman, as soon as they were in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman was indistinctly heard to murmur, &lsquo;Perfect fool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of him,&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;He knows who&rsquo;s the best solicitor
      in London, and it&rsquo;s not every man can say the same. But, I say, didn&rsquo;t I
      pitch it in hot?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman returned no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; said the lawyer, pausing, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with the long-suffering
      Pitman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had no right to speak of me as you did,&rsquo; the artist broke out; &lsquo;your
      language was perfectly unjustifiable; you have wounded me deeply.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never said a word about you,&rsquo; replied Michael. &lsquo;I spoke of Ezra Thomas;
      and do please remember that there&rsquo;s no such party.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s just as hard to bear,&rsquo; said the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by this time they had reached the corner of the by-street; and there
      was the faithful shoeblack, standing by the horses&rsquo; heads with a splendid
      assumption of dignity; and there was the piano, figuring forlorn upon the
      cart, while the rain beat upon its unprotected sides and trickled down its
      elegantly varnished legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shoeblack was again put in requisition to bring five or six strong
      fellows from the neighbouring public-house; and the last battle of the
      campaign opened. It is probable that Mr Gideon Forsyth had not yet taken
      his seat in the train for Hampton Court, before Michael opened the door of
      the chambers, and the grunting porters deposited the Broadwood grand in
      the middle of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said the lawyer, after he had sent the men about their
      business, &lsquo;one more precaution. We must leave him the key of the piano,
      and we must contrive that he shall find it. Let me see.&rsquo; And he built a
      square tower of cigars upon the top of the instrument, and dropped the key
      into the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor young man,&rsquo; said the artist, as they descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is in a devil of a position,&rsquo; assented Michael drily. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll brace him
      up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that reminds me,&rsquo; observed the excellent Pitman, &lsquo;that I fear I
      displayed a most ungrateful temper. I had no right, I see, to resent
      expressions, wounding as they were, which were in no sense directed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; cried Michael, getting on the cart. &lsquo;Not a word more,
      Pitman. Very proper feeling on your part; no man of self-respect can stand
      by and hear his alias insulted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain had now ceased, Michael was fairly sober, the body had been
      disposed of, and the friends were reconciled. The return to the mews was
      therefore (in comparison with previous stages of the day&rsquo;s adventures)
      quite a holiday outing; and when they had returned the cart and walked
      forth again from the stable-yard, unchallenged, and even unsuspected,
      Pitman drew a deep breath of joy. &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;we can go home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pitman,&rsquo; said the lawyer, stopping short, &lsquo;your recklessness fills me
      with concern. What! we have been wet through the greater part of the day,
      and you propose, in cold blood, to go home! No, sir&mdash;hot Scotch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And taking his friend&rsquo;s arm he led him sternly towards the nearest
      public-house. Nor was Pitman (I regret to say) wholly unwilling. Now that
      peace was restored and the body gone, a certain innocent skittishness
      began to appear in the manners of the artist; and when he touched his
      steaming glass to Michael&rsquo;s, he giggled aloud like a venturesome
      schoolgirl at a picnic.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. Glorious Conclusion of Michael Finsbury&rsquo;s Holiday
    </h2>
    <p>
      I know Michael Finsbury personally; my business&mdash;I know the
      awkwardness of having such a man for a lawyer&mdash;still it&rsquo;s an old
      story now, and there is such a thing as gratitude, and, in short, my legal
      business, although now (I am thankful to say) of quite a placid character,
      remains entirely in Michael&rsquo;s hands. But the trouble is I have no natural
      talent for addresses; I learn one for every man&mdash;that is friendship&rsquo;s
      offering; and the friend who subsequently changes his residence is dead to
      me, memory refusing to pursue him. Thus it comes about that, as I always
      write to Michael at his office, I cannot swear to his number in the King&rsquo;s
      Road. Of course (like my neighbours), I have been to dinner there. Of late
      years, since his accession to wealth, neglect of business, and election to
      the club, these little festivals have become common. He picks up a few
      fellows in the smoking-room&mdash;all men of Attic wit&mdash;myself, for
      instance, if he has the luck to find me disengaged; a string of hansoms
      may be observed (by Her Majesty) bowling gaily through St James&rsquo;s Park;
      and in a quarter of an hour the party surrounds one of the best appointed
      boards in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the time of which we write the house in the King&rsquo;s Road (let us
      still continue to call it No. 233) was kept very quiet; when Michael
      entertained guests it was at the halls of Nichol or Verrey that he would
      convene them, and the door of his private residence remained closed
      against his friends. The upper storey, which was sunny, was set apart for
      his father; the drawing-room was never opened; the dining-room was the
      scene of Michael&rsquo;s life. It is in this pleasant apartment, sheltered from
      the curiosity of King&rsquo;s Road by wire blinds, and entirely surrounded by
      the lawyer&rsquo;s unrivalled library of poetry and criminal trials, that we
      find him sitting down to his dinner after his holiday with Pitman. A spare
      old lady, with very bright eyes and a mouth humorously compressed, waited
      upon the lawyer&rsquo;s needs; in every line of her countenance she betrayed the
      fact that she was an old retainer; in every word that fell from her lips
      she flaunted the glorious circumstance of a Scottish origin; and the fear
      with which this powerful combination fills the boldest was obviously no
      stranger to the bosom of our friend. The hot Scotch having somewhat warmed
      up the embers of the Heidsieck. It was touching to observe the master&rsquo;s
      eagerness to pull himself together under the servant&rsquo;s eye; and when he
      remarked, &lsquo;I think, Teena, I&rsquo;ll take a brandy and soda,&rsquo; he spoke like a
      man doubtful of his elocution, and not half certain of obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No such a thing, Mr Michael,&rsquo; was the prompt return. &lsquo;Clar&rsquo;t and water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, Teena, I daresay you know best,&rsquo; said the master. &lsquo;Very
      fatiguing day at the office, though.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; said the retainer, &lsquo;ye never were near the office!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O yes, I was though; I was repeatedly along Fleet Street,&rsquo; returned
      Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty pliskies ye&rsquo;ve been at this day!&rsquo; cried the old lady, with
      humorous alacrity; and then, &lsquo;Take care&mdash;don&rsquo;t break my crystal!&rsquo; she
      cried, as the lawyer came within an ace of knocking the glasses off the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how is he keeping?&rsquo; asked Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, just the same, Mr Michael, just the way he&rsquo;ll be till the end, worthy
      man!&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;But ye&rsquo;ll not be the first that&rsquo;s asked me that the
      day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No?&rsquo; said the lawyer. &lsquo;Who else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s a joke, too,&rsquo; said Teena grimly. &lsquo;A friend of yours: Mr
      Morris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morris! What was the little beggar wanting here?&rsquo; enquired Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wantin&rsquo;? To see him,&rsquo; replied the housekeeper, completing her meaning by
      a movement of the thumb toward the upper storey. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s by his way of it;
      but I&rsquo;ve an idee of my own. He tried to bribe me, Mr Michael. Bribe&mdash;me!&rsquo; 
      she repeated, with inimitable scorn. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s no&rsquo; kind of a young
      gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he so?&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;I bet he didn&rsquo;t offer much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more he did,&rsquo; replied Teena; nor could any subsequent questioning
      elicit from her the sum with which the thrifty leather merchant had
      attempted to corrupt her. &lsquo;But I sent him about his business,&rsquo; she said
      gallantly. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll not come here again in a hurry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He mustn&rsquo;t see my father, you know; mind that!&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
      going to have any public exhibition to a little beast like him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No fear of me lettin&rsquo; him,&rsquo; replied the trusty one. &lsquo;But the joke is
      this, Mr Michael&mdash;see, ye&rsquo;re upsettin&rsquo; the sauce, that&rsquo;s a clean
      tablecloth&mdash;the best of the joke is that he thinks your father&rsquo;s dead
      and you&rsquo;re keepin&rsquo; it dark.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael whistled. &lsquo;Set a thief to catch a thief,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Exac&rsquo;ly what I told him!&rsquo; cried the delighted dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make him dance for that,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ye get the law of him some way?&rsquo; suggested Teena truculently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I could, and I&rsquo;m quite sure I don&rsquo;t want to,&rsquo; replied
      Michael. &lsquo;But I say, Teena, I really don&rsquo;t believe this claret&rsquo;s
      wholesome; it&rsquo;s not a sound, reliable wine. Give us a brandy and soda,
      there&rsquo;s a good soul.&rsquo; Teena&rsquo;s face became like adamant. &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said
      the lawyer fretfully, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t eat any more dinner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye can please yourself about that, Mr Michael,&rsquo; said Teena, and began
      composedly to take away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do wish Teena wasn&rsquo;t a faithful servant!&rsquo; sighed the lawyer, as he
      issued into Kings&rsquo;s Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain had ceased; the wind still blew, but only with a pleasant
      freshness; the town, in the clear darkness of the night, glittered with
      street-lamps and shone with glancing rain-pools. &lsquo;Come, this is better,&rsquo; 
      thought the lawyer to himself, and he walked on eastward, lending a
      pleased ear to the wheels and the million footfalls of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the end of the King&rsquo;s Road he remembered his brandy and soda, and
      entered a flaunting public-house. A good many persons were present, a
      waterman from a cab-stand, half a dozen of the chronically unemployed, a
      gentleman (in one corner) trying to sell aesthetic photographs out of a
      leather case to another and very youthful gentleman with a yellow goatee,
      and a pair of lovers debating some fine shade (in the other). But the
      centre-piece and great attraction was a little old man, in a black,
      ready-made surtout, which was obviously a recent purchase. On the marble
      table in front of him, beside a sandwich and a glass of beer, there lay a
      battered forage cap. His hand fluttered abroad with oratorical gestures;
      his voice, naturally shrill, was plainly tuned to the pitch of the lecture
      room; and by arts, comparable to those of the Ancient Mariner, he was now
      holding spellbound the barmaid, the waterman, and four of the unemployed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have examined all the theatres in London,&rsquo; he was saying; &lsquo;and pacing
      the principal entrances, I have ascertained them to be ridiculously
      disproportionate to the requirements of their audiences. The doors opened
      the wrong way&mdash;I forget at this moment which it is, but have a note
      of it at home; they were frequently locked during the performance, and
      when the auditorium was literally thronged with English people. You have
      probably not had my opportunities of comparing distant lands; but I can
      assure you this has been long ago recognized as a mark of aristocratic
      government. Do you suppose, in a country really self-governed, such abuses
      could exist? Your own intelligence, however uncultivated, tells you they
      could not. Take Austria, a country even possibly more enslaved than
      England. I have myself conversed with one of the survivors of the Ring
      Theatre, and though his colloquial German was not very good, I succeeded
      in gathering a pretty clear idea of his opinion of the case. But, what
      will perhaps interest you still more, here is a cutting on the subject
      from a Vienna newspaper, which I will now read to you, translating as I
      go. You can see for yourselves; it is printed in the German character.&rsquo; 
      And he held the cutting out for verification, much as a conjuror passes a
      trick orange along the front bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo, old gentleman! Is this you?&rsquo; said Michael, laying his hand upon
      the orator&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure turned with a convulsion of alarm, and showed the countenance
      of Mr Joseph Finsbury. &lsquo;You, Michael!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no one with you,
      is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Michael, ordering a brandy and soda, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nobody with
      me; whom do you expect?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought of Morris or John,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, evidently greatly
      relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil would I be doing with Morris or John?&rsquo; cried the nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something in that,&rsquo; returned Joseph. &lsquo;And I believe I can trust
      you. I believe you will stand by me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hardly know what you mean,&rsquo; said the lawyer, &lsquo;but if you are in need of
      money I am flush.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that, my dear boy,&rsquo; said the uncle, shaking him by the hand.
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; responded the nephew. &lsquo;I stand treat, Uncle Joseph; what will
      you have?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take another sandwich. I
      daresay I surprise you,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;with my presence in a public-house;
      but the fact is, I act on a sound but little-known principle of my own&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, it&rsquo;s better known than you suppose,&rsquo; said Michael sipping his brandy
      and soda. &lsquo;I always act on it myself when I want a drink.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, who was anxious to propitiate Michael, laughed a
      cheerless laugh. &lsquo;You have such a flow of spirits,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I am sure I
      often find it quite amusing. But regarding this principle of which I was
      about to speak. It is that of accommodating one&rsquo;s-self to the manners of
      any land (however humble) in which our lot may be cast. Now, in France,
      for instance, every one goes to a cafe for his meals; in America, to what
      is called a &ldquo;two-bit house&rdquo;; in England the people resort to such an
      institution as the present for refreshment. With sandwiches, tea, and an
      occasional glass of bitter beer, a man can live luxuriously in London for
      fourteen pounds twelve shillings per annum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know,&rsquo; returned Michael, &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s not including clothes,
      washing, or boots. The whole thing, with cigars and occasional sprees,
      costs me over seven hundred a year.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was Michael&rsquo;s last interruption. He listened in good-humoured
      silence to the remainder of his uncle&rsquo;s lecture, which speedily branched
      to political reform, thence to the theory of the weather-glass, with an
      illustrative account of a bora in the Adriatic; thence again to the best
      manner of teaching arithmetic to the deaf-and-dumb; and with that, the
      sandwich being then no more, explicuit valde feliciter. A moment later the
      pair issued forth on the King&rsquo;s Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Michael,&rsquo; said his uncle, &lsquo;the reason that I am here is because I cannot
      endure those nephews of mine. I find them intolerable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay you do,&rsquo; assented Michael, &lsquo;I never could stand them for a
      moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me speak,&rsquo; continued the old gentleman bitterly; &lsquo;I
      never was allowed to get a word in edgewise; I was shut up at once with
      some impertinent remark. They kept me on short allowance of pencils, when
      I wished to make notes of the most absorbing interest; the daily newspaper
      was guarded from me like a young baby from a gorilla. Now, you know me,
      Michael. I live for my calculations; I live for my manifold and
      ever-changing views of life; pens and paper and the productions of the
      popular press are to me as important as food and drink; and my life was
      growing quite intolerable when, in the confusion of that fortunate railway
      accident at Browndean, I made my escape. They must think me dead, and are
      trying to deceive the world for the chance of the tontine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the way, how do you stand for money?&rsquo; asked Michael kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pecuniarily speaking, I am rich,&rsquo; returned the old man with cheerfulness.
      &lsquo;I am living at present at the rate of one hundred a year, with unlimited
      pens and paper; the British Museum at which to get books; and all the
      newspapers I choose to read. But it&rsquo;s extraordinary how little a man of
      intellectual interest requires to bother with books in a progressive age.
      The newspapers supply all the conclusions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;come and stay with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Michael,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very kind of you, but you
      scarcely understand what a peculiar position I occupy. There are some
      little financial complications; as a guardian, my efforts were not
      altogether blessed; and not to put too fine a point upon the matter, I am
      absolutely in the power of that vile fellow, Morris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should be disguised,&rsquo; cried Michael eagerly; &lsquo;I will lend you a pair
      of window-glass spectacles and some red side-whiskers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had already canvassed that idea,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman, &lsquo;but
      feared to awaken remark in my unpretentious lodgings. The aristocracy, I
      am well aware&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But see here,&rsquo; interrupted Michael, &lsquo;how do you come to have any money at
      all? Don&rsquo;t make a stranger of me, Uncle Joseph; I know all about the
      trust, and the hash you made of it, and the assignment you were forced to
      make to Morris.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph narrated his dealings with the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, but I say, this won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; cried the lawyer. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve put your foot in
      it. You had no right to do what you did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The whole thing is mine, Michael,&rsquo; protested the old gentleman. &lsquo;I
      founded and nursed that business on principles entirely of my own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rsquo; said the lawyer; &lsquo;but you made an assignment, you
      were forced to make it, too; even then your position was extremely shaky;
      but now, my dear sir, it means the dock.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible,&rsquo; cried Joseph; &lsquo;the law cannot be so unjust as that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the cream of the thing,&rsquo; interrupted Michael, with a sudden shout of
      laughter, &lsquo;the cream of the thing is this, that of course you&rsquo;ve downed
      the leather business! I must say, Uncle Joseph, you have strange ideas of
      law, but I like your taste in humour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see nothing to laugh at,&rsquo; observed Mr Finsbury tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And talking of that, has Morris any power to sign for the firm?&rsquo; asked
      Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one but myself,&rsquo; replied Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor devil of a Morris! O, poor devil of a Morris!&rsquo; cried the lawyer in
      delight. &lsquo;And his keeping up the farce that you&rsquo;re at home! O, Morris, the
      Lord has delivered you into my hands! Let me see, Uncle Joseph, what do
      you suppose the leather business worth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was worth a hundred thousand,&rsquo; said Joseph bitterly, &lsquo;when it was in
      my hands. But then there came a Scotsman&mdash;it is supposed he had a
      certain talent&mdash;it was entirely directed to bookkeeping&mdash;no
      accountant in London could understand a word of any of his books; and then
      there was Morris, who is perfectly incompetent. And now it is worth very
      little. Morris tried to sell it last year; and Pogram and Jarris offered
      only four thousand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall turn my attention to leather,&rsquo; said Michael with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You?&rsquo; asked Joseph. &lsquo;I advise you not. There is nothing in the whole
      field of commerce more surprising than the fluctuations of the leather
      market. Its sensitiveness may be described as morbid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, Uncle Joseph, what have you done with all that money?&rsquo; asked the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Paid it into a bank and drew twenty pounds,&rsquo; answered Mr Finsbury
      promptly. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;Tomorrow I shall send down a clerk with a
      cheque for a hundred, and he&rsquo;ll draw out the original sum and return it to
      the Anglo-Patagonian, with some sort of explanation which I will try to
      invent for you. That will clear your feet, and as Morris can&rsquo;t touch a
      penny of it without forgery, it will do no harm to my little scheme.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what am I to do?&rsquo; asked Joseph; &lsquo;I cannot live upon nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear?&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;I send you a cheque for a hundred;
      which leaves you eighty to go along upon; and when that&rsquo;s done, apply to
      me again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather not be beholden to your bounty all the same,&rsquo; said Joseph,
      biting at his white moustache. &lsquo;I would rather live on my own money, since
      I have it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael grasped his arm. &lsquo;Will nothing make you believe,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;that
      I am trying to save you from Dartmoor?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His earnestness staggered the old man. &lsquo;I must turn my attention to law,&rsquo; 
      he said; &lsquo;it will be a new field; for though, of course, I understand its
      general principles, I have never really applied my mind to the details,
      and this view of yours, for example, comes on me entirely by surprise. But
      you may be right, and of course at my time of life&mdash;for I am no
      longer young&mdash;any really long term of imprisonment would be highly
      prejudicial. But, my dear nephew, I have no claim on you; you have no call
      to support me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said Michael; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll probably get it out of the leather
      business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And having taken down the old gentleman&rsquo;s address, Michael left him at the
      corner of a street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a wonderful old muddler!&rsquo; he reflected, &lsquo;and what a singular thing
      is life! I seem to be condemned to be the instrument of Providence. Let me
      see; what have I done today? Disposed of a dead body, saved Pitman, saved
      my Uncle Joseph, brightened up Forsyth, and drunk a devil of a lot of most
      indifferent liquor. Let&rsquo;s top off with a visit to my cousins, and be the
      instrument of Providence in earnest. Tomorrow I can turn my attention to
      leather; tonight I&rsquo;ll just make it lively for &lsquo;em in a friendly spirit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      About a quarter of an hour later, as the clocks were striking eleven, the
      instrument of Providence descended from a hansom, and, bidding the driver
      wait, rapped at the door of No. 16 John Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was promptly opened by Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, it&rsquo;s you, Michael,&rsquo; he said, carefully blocking up the narrow opening:
      &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very late.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael without a word reached forth, grasped Morris warmly by the hand,
      and gave it so extreme a squeeze that the sullen householder fell back.
      Profiting by this movement, the lawyer obtained a footing in the lobby and
      marched into the dining-room, with Morris at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s my Uncle Joseph?&rsquo; demanded Michael, sitting down in the most
      comfortable chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not been very well lately,&rsquo; replied Morris; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s staying at
      Browndean; John is nursing him; and I am alone, as you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael smiled to himself. &lsquo;I want to see him on particular business,&rsquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to see my uncle when you won&rsquo;t let me see your father,&rsquo; 
      returned Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fiddlestick,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;My father is my father; but Joseph is just
      as much my uncle as he&rsquo;s yours; and you have no right to sequestrate his
      person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do no such thing,&rsquo; said Morris doggedly. &lsquo;He is not well, he is
      dangerously ill and nobody can see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, then,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make a clean breast of it.
      I have come down like the opossum, Morris; I have come to compromise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Morris turned as pale as death, and then a flush of wrath against the
      injustice of man&rsquo;s destiny dyed his very temples. &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; he
      cried, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.&rsquo; And when Michael had assured him of
      his seriousness, &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; he cried, with another deep flush, &lsquo;I
      won&rsquo;t; so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; said Michael queerly. &lsquo;You say your uncle is dangerously ill, and
      you won&rsquo;t compromise? There&rsquo;s something very fishy about that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; cried Morris hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I only say it&rsquo;s fishy,&rsquo; returned Michael, &lsquo;that is, pertaining to the
      finny tribe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to insinuate anything?&rsquo; cried Morris stormily, trying the
      high hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Insinuate?&rsquo; repeated Michael. &lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s begin to use awkward
      expressions! Let us drown our differences in a bottle, like two affable
      kinsmen. The Two Affable Kinsmen, sometimes attributed to Shakespeare,&rsquo; he
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris&rsquo;s mind was labouring like a mill. &lsquo;Does he suspect? or is this
      chance and stuff? Should I soap, or should I bully? Soap,&rsquo; he concluded.
      &lsquo;It gains time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he aloud, and with rather a painful
      affectation of heartiness, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s long since we have had an evening
      together, Michael; and though my habits (as you know) are very temperate,
      I may as well make an exception. Excuse me one moment till I fetch a
      bottle of whisky from the cellar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No whisky for me,&rsquo; said Michael; &lsquo;a little of the old still champagne or
      nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Morris stood irresolute, for the wine was very valuable: the
      next he had quitted the room without a word. His quick mind had perceived
      his advantage; in thus dunning him for the cream of the cellar, Michael
      was playing into his hand. &lsquo;One bottle?&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;By George, I&rsquo;ll give
      him two! this is no moment for economy; and once the beast is drunk, it&rsquo;s
      strange if I don&rsquo;t wring his secret out of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With two bottles, accordingly, he returned. Glasses were produced, and
      Morris filled them with hospitable grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I drink to you, cousin!&rsquo; he cried gaily. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t spare the wine-cup in my
      house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael drank his glass deliberately, standing at the table; filled it
      again, and returned to his chair, carrying the bottle along with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The spoils of war!&rsquo; he said apologetically. &lsquo;The weakest goes to the
      wall. Science, Morris, science.&rsquo; Morris could think of no reply, and for
      an appreciable interval silence reigned. But two glasses of the still
      champagne produced a rapid change in Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a want of vivacity about you, Morris,&rsquo; he observed. &lsquo;You may be
      deep; but I&rsquo;ll be hanged if you&rsquo;re vivacious!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What makes you think me deep?&rsquo; asked Morris with an air of pleased
      simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you won&rsquo;t compromise,&rsquo; said the lawyer. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re deep dog, Morris,
      very deep dog, not t&rsquo; compromise&mdash;remarkable deep dog. And a very
      good glass of wine; it&rsquo;s the only respectable feature in the Finsbury
      family, this wine; rarer thing than a title&mdash;much rarer. Now a man
      with glass wine like this in cellar, I wonder why won&rsquo;t compromise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, YOU wouldn&rsquo;t compromise before, you know,&rsquo; said the smiling Morris.
      &lsquo;Turn about is fair play.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder why <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo; compromise? I wonder why YOU wouldn&rsquo;?&rsquo; 
      enquired Michael. &lsquo;I wonder why we each think the other wouldn&rsquo;? &lsquo;S quite
      a remarrable&mdash;remarkable problem,&rsquo; he added, triumphing over oral
      obstacles, not without obvious pride. &lsquo;Wonder what we each think&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you suppose to have been my reason?&rsquo; asked Morris adroitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael looked at him and winked. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s cool,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Next thing,
      you&rsquo;ll ask me to help you out of the muddle. I know I&rsquo;m emissary of
      Providence, but not that kind! You get out of it yourself, like Aesop and
      the other fellow. Must be dreadful muddle for young orphan o&rsquo; forty;
      leather business and all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not sure I know myself,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;This is exc&rsquo;lent vintage, sir&mdash;exc&rsquo;lent
      vintage. Nothing against the tipple. Only thing: here&rsquo;s a valuable uncle
      disappeared. Now, what I want to know: where&rsquo;s valuable uncle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have told you: he is at Browndean,&rsquo; answered Morris, furtively wiping
      his brow, for these repeated hints began to tell upon him cruelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very easy say Brown&mdash;Browndee&mdash;no&rsquo; so easy after all!&rsquo; cried
      Michael. &lsquo;Easy say; anything&rsquo;s easy say, when you can say it. What I don&rsquo; 
      like&rsquo;s total disappearance of an uncle. Not businesslike.&rsquo; And he wagged
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all perfectly simple,&rsquo; returned Morris, with laborious calm. &lsquo;There
      is no mystery. He stays at Browndean, where he got a shake in the
      accident.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;got devil of a shake!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you say that?&rsquo; cried Morris sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Best possible authority. Told me so yourself,&rsquo; said the lawyer. &lsquo;But if
      you tell me contrary now, of course I&rsquo;m bound to believe either the one
      story or the other. Point is I&rsquo;ve upset this bottle, still champagne&rsquo;s
      exc&rsquo;lent thing carpet&mdash;point is, is valuable uncle dead&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;bury?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris sprang from his seat. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rsquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say it&rsquo;s exc&rsquo;lent thing carpet,&rsquo; replied Michael, rising. &lsquo;Exc&rsquo;lent
      thing promote healthy action of the skin. Well, it&rsquo;s all one, anyway. Give
      my love to Uncle Champagne.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going away?&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Awf&rsquo;ly sorry, ole man. Got to sit up sick friend,&rsquo; said the wavering
      Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall not go till you have explained your hints,&rsquo; returned Morris
      fiercely. &lsquo;What do you mean? What brought you here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No offence, I trust,&rsquo; said the lawyer, turning round as he opened the
      door; &lsquo;only doing my duty as shemishery of Providence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Groping his way to the front-door, he opened it with some difficulty, and
      descended the steps to the hansom. The tired driver looked up as he
      approached, and asked where he was to go next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael observed that Morris had followed him to the steps; a brilliant
      inspiration came to him. &lsquo;Anything t&rsquo; give pain,&rsquo; he reflected. . . .
      &lsquo;Drive Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard,&rsquo; he added aloud, holding to the wheel to steady
      himself; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s something devilish fishy, cabby, about those cousins.
      Mush&rsquo; be cleared up! Drive Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, sir,&rsquo; said the man, with the ready sympathy of the
      lower orders for an intoxicated gentleman. &lsquo;I had better take you home,
      sir; you can go to Scotland Yard tomorrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it as friend or as perfessional man you advise me not to go Shcotlan&rsquo; 
      Yard t&rsquo;night?&rsquo; enquired Michael. &lsquo;All righ&rsquo;, never min&rsquo; Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard,
      drive Gaiety bar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Gaiety bar is closed,&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then home,&rsquo; said Michael, with the same cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where to, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said Michael, entering the vehicle, &lsquo;drive
      Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard and ask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll have a card,&rsquo; said the man, through the little aperture in the
      top, &lsquo;give me your card-case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What imagi&mdash;imagination in a cabby!&rsquo; cried the lawyer, producing his
      card-case, and handing it to the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man read it by the light of the lamp. &lsquo;Mr Michael Finsbury, 233 King&rsquo;s
      Road, Chelsea. Is that it, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Right you are,&rsquo; cried Michael, &lsquo;drive there if you can see way.&rsquo; 
    </p>

      CHAPTER X. Gideon Forsyth and the Broadwood Grand
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reader has perhaps read that remarkable work, Who Put Back the Clock?
      by E. H. B., which appeared for several days upon the railway bookstalls
      and then vanished entirely from the face of the earth. Whether eating Time
      makes the chief of his diet out of old editions; whether Providence has
      passed a special enactment on behalf of authors; or whether these last
      have taken the law into their own hand, bound themselves into a dark
      conspiracy with a password, which I would die rather than reveal, and
      night after night sally forth under some vigorous leader, such as Mr James
      Payn or Mr Walter Besant, on their task of secret spoliation&mdash;certain
      it is, at least, that the old editions pass, giving place to new. To the
      proof, it is believed there are now only three copies extant of Who Put
      Back the Clock? one in the British Museum, successfully concealed by a
      wrong entry in the catalogue; another in one of the cellars (the cellar
      where the music accumulates) of the Advocates&rsquo; Library at Edinburgh; and a
      third, bound in morocco, in the possession of Gideon Forsyth. To account
      for the very different fate attending this third exemplar, the readiest
      theory is to suppose that Gideon admired the tale. How to explain that
      admiration might appear (to those who have perused the work) more
      difficult; but the weakness of a parent is extreme, and Gideon (and not
      his uncle, whose initials he had humorously borrowed) was the author of
      Who Put Back the Clock? He had never acknowledged it, or only to some
      intimate friends while it was still in proof; after its appearance and
      alarming failure, the modesty of the novelist had become more pressing,
      and the secret was now likely to be better kept than that of the
      authorship of Waverley.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of the work (for the date of my tale is already yesterday) still
      figured in dusty solitude in the bookstall at Waterloo; and Gideon, as he
      passed with his ticket for Hampton Court, smiled contemptuously at the
      creature of his thoughts. What an idle ambition was the author&rsquo;s! How far
      beneath him was the practice of that childish art! With his hand closing
      on his first brief, he felt himself a man at last; and the muse who
      presides over the police romance, a lady presumably of French extraction,
      fled his neighbourhood, and returned to join the dance round the springs
      of Helicon, among her Grecian sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robust, practical reflection still cheered the young barrister upon his
      journey. Again and again he selected the little country-house in its islet
      of great oaks, which he was to make his future home. Like a prudent
      householder, he projected improvements as he passed; to one he added a
      stable, to another a tennis-court, a third he supplied with a becoming
      rustic boat-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How little a while ago,&rsquo; he could not but reflect, &lsquo;I was a careless
      young dog with no thought but to be comfortable! I cared for nothing but
      boating and detective novels. I would have passed an old-fashioned
      country-house with large kitchen-garden, stabling, boat-house, and
      spacious offices, without so much as a look, and certainly would have made
      no enquiry as to the drains. How a man ripens with the years!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligent reader will perceive the ravages of Miss Hazeltine. Gideon
      had carried Julia straight to Mr Bloomfield&rsquo;s house; and that gentleman,
      having been led to understand she was the victim of oppression, had
      noisily espoused her cause. He worked himself into a fine breathing heat;
      in which, to a man of his temperament, action became needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know which is the worse,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;the fraudulent old villain
      or the unmanly young cub. I will write to the Pall Mall and expose them.
      Nonsense, sir; they must be exposed! It&rsquo;s a public duty. Did you not tell
      me the fellow was a Tory? O, the uncle is a Radical lecturer, is he? No
      doubt the uncle has been grossly wronged. But of course, as you say, that
      makes a change; it becomes scarce so much a public duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he sought and instantly found a fresh outlet for his alacrity. Miss
      Hazeltine (he now perceived) must be kept out of the way; his houseboat
      was lying ready&mdash;he had returned but a day or two before from his
      usual cruise; there was no place like a houseboat for concealment; and
      that very morning, in the teeth of the easterly gale, Mr and Mrs
      Bloomfield and Miss Julia Hazeltine had started forth on their untimely
      voyage. Gideon pled in vain to be allowed to join the party. &lsquo;No, Gid,&rsquo; 
      said his uncle. &lsquo;You will be watched; you must keep away from us.&rsquo; Nor had
      the barrister ventured to contest this strange illusion; for he feared if
      he rubbed off any of the romance, that Mr Bloomfield might weary of the
      whole affair. And his discretion was rewarded; for the Squirradical,
      laying a heavy hand upon his nephew&rsquo;s shoulder, had added these notable
      expressions: &lsquo;I see what you are after, Gid. But if you&rsquo;re going to get
      the girl, you have to work, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These pleasing sounds had cheered the barrister all day, as he sat reading
      in chambers; they continued to form the ground-base of his manly musings
      as he was whirled to Hampton Court; even when he landed at the station,
      and began to pull himself together for his delicate interview, the voice
      of Uncle Ned and the eyes of Julia were not forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now it began to rain surprises: in all Hampton Court there was no
      Kurnaul Villa, no Count Tarnow, and no count. This was strange; but,
      viewed in the light of the incoherency of his instructions, not perhaps
      inexplicable; Mr Dickson had been lunching, and he might have made some
      fatal oversight in the address. What was the thoroughly prompt, manly, and
      businesslike step? thought Gideon; and he answered himself at once: &lsquo;A
      telegram, very laconic.&rsquo; Speedily the wires were flashing the following
      very important missive: &lsquo;Dickson, Langham Hotel. Villa and persons both
      unknown here, suppose erroneous address; follow self next train.&mdash;Forsyth.&rsquo; 
      And at the Langham Hotel, sure enough, with a brow expressive of dispatch
      and intellectual effort, Gideon descended not long after from a smoking
      hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not suppose that Gideon will ever forget the Langham Hotel. No Count
      Tarnow was one thing; no John Dickson and no Ezra Thomas, quite another.
      How, why, and what next, danced in his bewildered brain; from every centre
      of what we playfully call the human intellect incongruous messages were
      telegraphed; and before the hubbub of dismay had quite subsided, the
      barrister found himself driving furiously for his chambers. There was at
      least a cave of refuge; it was at least a place to think in; and he
      climbed the stair, put his key in the lock and opened the door, with some
      approach to hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all dark within, for the night had some time fallen; but Gideon
      knew his room, he knew where the matches stood on the end of the
      chimney-piece; and he advanced boldly, and in so doing dashed himself
      against a heavy body; where (slightly altering the expressions of the
      song) no heavy body should have been. There had been nothing there when
      Gideon went out; he had locked the door behind him, he had found it locked
      on his return, no one could have entered, the furniture could not have
      changed its own position. And yet undeniably there was a something there.
      He thrust out his hands in the darkness. Yes, there was something,
      something large, something smooth, something cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven forgive me!&rsquo; said Gideon, &lsquo;it feels like a piano.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next moment he remembered the vestas in his waistcoat pocket and
      had struck a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed a piano that met his doubtful gaze; a vast and costly
      instrument, stained with the rains of the afternoon and defaced with
      recent scratches. The light of the vesta was reflected from the varnished
      sides, like a staice in quiet water; and in the farther end of the room
      the shadow of that strange visitor loomed bulkily and wavered on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon let the match burn to his fingers, and the darkness closed once
      more on his bewilderment. Then with trembling hands he lit the lamp and
      drew near. Near or far, there was no doubt of the fact: the thing was a
      piano. There, where by all the laws of God and man it was impossible that
      it should be&mdash;there the thing impudently stood. Gideon threw open the
      keyboard and struck a chord. Not a sound disturbed the quiet of the room.
      &lsquo;Is there anything wrong with me?&rsquo; he thought, with a pang; and drawing in
      a seat, obstinately persisted in his attempts to ravish silence, now with
      sparkling arpeggios, now with a sonata of Beethoven&rsquo;s which (in happier
      days) he knew to be one of the loudest pieces of that powerful composer.
      Still not a sound. He gave the Broadwood two great bangs with his clenched
      first. All was still as the grave. The young barrister started to his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am stark-staring mad,&rsquo; he cried aloud, &lsquo;and no one knows it but myself.
      God&rsquo;s worst curse has fallen on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His fingers encountered his watch-chain; instantly he had plucked forth
      his watch and held it to his ear. He could hear it ticking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not deaf,&rsquo; he said aloud. &lsquo;I am only insane. My mind has quitted me
      for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked uneasily about the room, and&mdash;gazed with lacklustre eyes at
      the chair in which Mr Dickson had installed himself. The end of a cigar
      lay near on the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that was a dream; but God knows my mind
      is failing rapidly. I seem to be hungry, for instance; it&rsquo;s probably
      another hallucination. Still I might try. I shall have one more good meal;
      I shall go to the Cafe Royal, and may possibly be removed from there
      direct to the asylum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered with morbid interest, as he descended the stairs, how he would
      first betray his terrible condition&mdash;would he attack a waiter? or eat
      glass?&mdash;and when he had mounted into a cab, he bade the man drive to
      Nichol&rsquo;s, with a lurking fear that there was no such place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flaring, gassy entrance of the cafe speedily set his mind at rest; he
      was cheered besides to recognize his favourite waiter; his orders appeared
      to be coherent; the dinner, when it came, was quite a sensible meal, and
      he ate it with enjoyment. &lsquo;Upon my word,&rsquo; he reflected, &lsquo;I am about
      tempted to indulge a hope. Have I been hasty? Have I done what Robert
      Skill would have done?&rsquo; Robert Skill (I need scarcely mention) was the
      name of the principal character in Who Put Back the Clock? It had occurred
      to the author as a brilliant and probable invention; to readers of a
      critical turn, Robert appeared scarce upon a level with his surname; but
      it is the difficulty of the police romance, that the reader is always a
      man of such vastly greater ingenuity than the writer. In the eyes of his
      creator, however, Robert Skill was a word to conjure with; the thought
      braced and spurred him; what that brilliant creature would have done
      Gideon would do also. This frame of mind is not uncommon; the distressed
      general, the baited divine, the hesitating author, decide severally to do
      what Napoleon, what St Paul, what Shakespeare would have done; and there
      remains only the minor question, What is that? In Gideon&rsquo;s case one thing
      was clear: Skill was a man of singular decision, he would have taken some
      step (whatever it was) at once; and the only step that Gideon could think
      of was to return to his chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being achieved, all further inspiration failed him, and he stood
      pitifully staring at the instrument of his confusion. To touch the keys
      again was more than he durst venture on; whether they had maintained their
      former silence, or responded with the tones of the last trump, it would
      have equally dethroned his resolution. &lsquo;It may be a practical jest,&rsquo; he
      reflected, &lsquo;though it seems elaborate and costly. And yet what else can it
      be? It MUST be a practical jest.&rsquo; And just then his eye fell upon a
      feature which seemed corroborative of that view: the pagoda of cigars
      which Michael had erected ere he left the chambers. &lsquo;Why that?&rsquo; reflected
      Gideon. &lsquo;It seems entirely irresponsible.&rsquo; And drawing near, he gingerly
      demolished it. &lsquo;A key,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;Why that? And why so conspicuously
      placed?&rsquo; He made the circuit of the instrument, and perceived the keyhole
      at the back. &lsquo;Aha! this is what the key is for,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;They wanted me
      to look inside. Stranger and stranger.&rsquo; And with that he turned the key
      and raised the lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what antics of agony, in what fits of flighty resolution, in what
      collapses of despair, Gideon consumed the night, it would be ungenerous to
      enquire too closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      That trill of tiny song with which the eaves-birds of London welcome the
      approach of day found him limp and rumpled and bloodshot, and with a mind
      still vacant of resource. He rose and looked forth unrejoicingly on
      blinded windows, an empty street, and the grey daylight dotted with the
      yellow lamps. There are mornings when the city seems to awake with a sick
      headache; this was one of them; and still the twittering reveille of the
      sparrows stirred in Gideon&rsquo;s spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Day here,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;and I still helpless! This must come to an end.&rsquo; 
      And he locked up the piano, put the key in his pocket, and set forth in
      quest of coffee. As he went, his mind trudged for the hundredth time a
      certain mill-road of terrors, misgivings, and regrets. To call in the
      police, to give up the body, to cover London with handbills describing
      John Dickson and Ezra Thomas, to fill the papers with paragraphs,
      Mysterious Occurrence in the Temple&mdash;Mr Forsyth admitted to bail,
      this was one course, an easy course, a safe course; but not, the more he
      reflected on it, not a pleasant one. For, was it not to publish abroad a
      number of singular facts about himself? A child ought to have seen through
      the story of these adventurers, and he had gaped and swallowed it. A
      barrister of the least self-respect should have refused to listen to
      clients who came before him in a manner so irregular, and he had listened.
      And O, if he had only listened; but he had gone upon their errand&mdash;he,
      a barrister, uninstructed even by the shadow of a solicitor&mdash;upon an
      errand fit only for a private detective; and alas!&mdash;and for the
      hundredth time the blood surged to his brow&mdash;he had taken their
      money! &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the thing is as plain as St Paul&rsquo;s. I shall be
      dishonoured! I have smashed my career for a five-pound note.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the possibility of being hanged in all innocence, and the
      certainty of a public and merited disgrace, no gentleman of spirit could
      long hesitate. After three gulps of that hot, snuffy, and muddy beverage,
      that passes on the streets of London for a decoction of the coffee berry,
      Gideon&rsquo;s mind was made up. He would do without the police. He must face
      the other side of the dilemma, and be Robert Skill in earnest. What would
      Robert Skill have done? How does a gentleman dispose of a dead body,
      honestly come by? He remembered the inimitable story of the hunchback;
      reviewed its course, and dismissed it for a worthless guide. It was
      impossible to prop a corpse on the corner of Tottenham Court Road without
      arousing fatal curiosity in the bosoms of the passers-by; as for lowering
      it down a London chimney, the physical obstacles were insurmountable. To
      get it on board a train and drop it out, or on the top of an omnibus and
      drop it off, were equally out of the question. To get it on a yacht and
      drop it overboard, was more conceivable; but for a man of moderate means
      it seemed extravagant. The hire of the yacht was in itself a
      consideration; the subsequent support of the whole crew (which seemed a
      necessary consequence) was simply not to be thought of. His uncle and the
      houseboat here occurred in very luminous colours to his mind. A musical
      composer (say, of the name of Jimson) might very well suffer, like
      Hogarth&rsquo;s musician before him, from the disturbances of London. He might
      very well be pressed for time to finish an opera&mdash;say the comic opera
      Orange Pekoe&mdash;Orange Pekoe, music by Jimson&mdash;&lsquo;this young
      maestro, one of the most promising of our recent English school&rsquo;&mdash;vigorous
      entrance of the drums, etc.&mdash;the whole character of Jimson and his
      music arose in bulk before the mind of Gideon. What more likely than
      Jimson&rsquo;s arrival with a grand piano (say, at Padwick), and his residence
      in a houseboat alone with the unfinished score of Orange Pekoe? His
      subsequent disappearance, leaving nothing behind but an empty piano case,
      it might be more difficult to account for. And yet even that was
      susceptible of explanation. For, suppose Jimson had gone mad over a fugal
      passage, and had thereupon destroyed the accomplice of his infamy, and
      plunged into the welcome river? What end, on the whole, more probable for
      a modern musician?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rsquo; cried Gideon. &lsquo;Jimson is the boy!&rsquo;

      CHAPTER XI. The Maestro Jimson
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr Edward Hugh Bloomfield having announced his intention to stay in the
      neighbourhood of Maidenhead, what more probable than that the Maestro
      Jimson should turn his mind toward Padwick? Near this pleasant riverside
      village he remembered to have observed an ancient, weedy houseboat lying
      moored beside a tuft of willows. It had stirred in him, in his careless
      hours, as he pulled down the river under a more familiar name, a certain
      sense of the romantic; and when the nice contrivance of his story was
      already complete in his mind, he had come near pulling it all down again,
      like an ungrateful clock, in order to introduce a chapter in which Richard
      Skill (who was always being decoyed somewhere) should be decoyed on board
      that lonely hulk by Lord Bellew and the American desperado Gin Sling. It
      was fortunate he had not done so, he reflected, since the hulk was now
      required for very different purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimson, a man of inconspicuous costume, but insinuating manners, had
      little difficulty in finding the hireling who had charge of the houseboat,
      and still less in persuading him to resign his care. The rent was almost
      nominal, the entry immediate, the key was exchanged against a suitable
      advance in money, and Jimson returned to town by the afternoon train to
      see about dispatching his piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will be down tomorrow,&rsquo; he had said reassuringly. &lsquo;My opera is waited
      for with such impatience, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, sure enough, about the hour of noon on the following day, Jimson
      might have been observed ascending the riverside road that goes from
      Padwick to Great Haverham, carrying in one hand a basket of provisions,
      and under the other arm a leather case containing (it is to be
      conjectured) the score of Orange Pekoe. It was October weather; the
      stone-grey sky was full of larks, the leaden mirror of the Thames
      brightened with autumnal foliage, and the fallen leaves of the chestnuts
      chirped under the composer&rsquo;s footing. There is no time of the year in
      England more courageous; and Jimson, though he was not without his
      troubles, whistled as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little above Padwick the river lies very solitary. On the opposite shore
      the trees of a private park enclose the view, the chimneys of the mansion
      just pricking forth above their clusters; on the near side the path is
      bordered by willows. Close among these lay the houseboat, a thing so
      soiled by the tears of the overhanging willows, so grown upon with
      parasites, so decayed, so battered, so neglected, such a haunt of rats, so
      advertised a storehouse of rheumatic agonies, that the heart of an
      intending occupant might well recoil. A plank, by way of flying
      drawbridge, joined it to the shore. And it was a dreary moment for Jimson
      when he pulled this after him and found himself alone on this unwholesome
      fortress. He could hear the rats scuttle and flop in the abhorred
      interior; the key cried among the wards like a thing in pain; the
      sitting-room was deep in dust, and smelt strong of bilge-water. It could
      not be called a cheerful spot, even for a composer absorbed in beloved
      toil; how much less for a young gentleman haunted by alarms and awaiting
      the arrival of a corpse!
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, cleared away a piece of the table, and attacked the cold
      luncheon in his basket. In case of any subsequent inquiry into the fate of
      Jimson, It was desirable he should be little seen: in other words, that he
      should spend the day entirely in the house. To this end, and further to
      corroborate his fable, he had brought in the leather case not only writing
      materials, but a ream of large-size music paper, such as he considered
      suitable for an ambitious character like Jimson&rsquo;s. &lsquo;And now to work,&rsquo; said
      he, when he had satisfied his appetite. &lsquo;We must leave traces of the
      wretched man&rsquo;s activity.&rsquo; And he wrote in bold characters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     ORANGE PEKOE.
     Op. 17.
     J. B. JIMSON.
     Vocal and p. f. score.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose they never do begin like this,&rsquo; reflected Gideon; &lsquo;but then
      it&rsquo;s quite out of the question for me to tackle a full score, and Jimson
      was so unconventional. A dedication would be found convincing, I believe.
      &ldquo;Dedicated to&rdquo; (let me see) &ldquo;to William Ewart Gladstone, by his obedient
      servant the composer.&rdquo; And now some music: I had better avoid the
      overture; it seems to present difficulties. Let&rsquo;s give an air for the
      tenor: key&mdash;O, something modern!&mdash;seven sharps.&rsquo; And he made a
      businesslike signature across the staves, and then paused and browsed for
      a while on the handle of his pen. Melody, with no better inspiration than
      a sheet of paper, is not usually found to spring unbidden in the mind of
      the amateur; nor is the key of seven sharps a place of much repose to the
      untried. He cast away that sheet. &lsquo;It will help to build up the character
      of Jimson,&rsquo; Gideon remarked, and again waited on the muse, in various keys
      and on divers sheets of paper, but all with results so inconsiderable that
      he stood aghast. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very odd,&rsquo; thought he. &lsquo;I seem to have less fancy
      than I thought, or this is an off-day with me; yet Jimson must leave
      something.&rsquo; And again he bent himself to the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the penetrating chill of the houseboat began to attack the very
      seat of life. He desisted from his unremunerative trial, and, to the
      audible annoyance of the rats, walked briskly up and down the cabin. Still
      he was cold. &lsquo;This is all nonsense,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the
      risk, but I will not catch a catarrh. I must get out of this den.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped on deck, and passing to the bow of his embarkation, looked for
      the first time up the river. He started. Only a few hundred yards above
      another houseboat lay moored among the willows. It was very
      spick-and-span, an elegant canoe hung at the stern, the windows were
      concealed by snowy curtains, a flag floated from a staff. The more Gideon
      looked at it, the more there mingled with his disgust a sense of impotent
      surprise. It was very like his uncle&rsquo;s houseboat; it was exceedingly like&mdash;it
      was identical. But for two circumstances, he could have sworn it was the
      same. The first, that his uncle had gone to Maidenhead, might be explained
      away by that flightiness of purpose which is so common a trait among the
      more than usually manly. The second, however, was conclusive: it was not
      in the least like Mr Bloomfield to display a banner on his floating
      residence; and if he ever did, it would certainly be dyed in hues of
      emblematical propriety. Now the Squirradical, like the vast majority of
      the more manly, had drawn knowledge at the wells of Cambridge&mdash;he was
      wooden spoon in the year 1850; and the flag upon the houseboat streamed on
      the afternoon air with the colours of that seat of Toryism, that cradle of
      Puseyism, that home of the inexact and the effete Oxford. Still it was
      strangely like, thought Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he thus looked and thought, the door opened, and a young lady
      stepped forth on deck. The barrister dropped and fled into his cabin&mdash;it
      was Julia Hazeltine! Through the window he watched her draw in the canoe,
      get on board of it, cast off, and come dropping downstream in his
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, all is up now,&rsquo; said he, and he fell on a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-afternoon, miss,&rsquo; said a voice on the water. Gideon knew it for the
      voice of his landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-afternoon,&rsquo; replied Julia, &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t know who you are; do I? O
      yes, I do though. You are the nice man that gave us leave to sketch from
      the old houseboat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon&rsquo;s heart leaped with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rsquo; returned the man. &lsquo;And what I wanted to say was as you
      couldn&rsquo;t do it any more. You see I&rsquo;ve let it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it!&rsquo; cried Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it for a month,&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;Seems strange, don&rsquo;t it? Can&rsquo;t see
      what the party wants with it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems very romantic of him, I think,&rsquo; said Julia, &lsquo;What sort of a
      person is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia in her canoe, the landlord in his wherry, were close alongside, and
      holding on by the gunwale of the houseboat; so that not a word was lost on
      Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a music-man,&rsquo; said the landlord, &lsquo;or at least that&rsquo;s what he told
      me, miss; come down here to write an op&rsquo;ra.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really!&rsquo; cried Julia, &lsquo;I never heard of anything so delightful! Why, we
      shall be able to slip down at night and hear him improvise! What is his
      name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jimson,&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jimson?&rsquo; repeated Julia, and interrogated her memory in vain. But indeed
      our rising school of English music boasts so many professors that we
      rarely hear of one till he is made a baronet. &lsquo;Are you sure you have it
      right?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Made him spell it to me,&rsquo; replied the landlord. &lsquo;J-I-M-S-O-N&mdash;Jimson;
      and his op&rsquo;ra&rsquo;s called&mdash;some kind of tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SOME KIND OF TEA!&rsquo; cried the girl. &lsquo;What a very singular name for an
      opera! What can it be about?&rsquo; And Gideon heard her pretty laughter flow
      abroad. &lsquo;We must try to get acquainted with this Mr Jimson; I feel sure he
      must be nice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, miss, I&rsquo;m afraid I must be going on. I&rsquo;ve got to be at Haverham,
      you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t let me keep you, you kind man!&rsquo; said Julia. &lsquo;Good afternoon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good afternoon to you, miss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon sat in the cabin a prey to the most harrowing thoughts. Here he was
      anchored to a rotting houseboat, soon to be anchored to it still more
      emphatically by the presence of the corpse, and here was the country
      buzzing about him, and young ladies already proposing pleasure parties to
      surround his house at night. Well, that meant the gallows; and much he
      cared for that. What troubled him now was Julia&rsquo;s indescribable levity.
      That girl would scrape acquaintance with anybody; she had no reserve, none
      of the enamel of the lady. She was familiar with a brute like his
      landlord; she took an immediate interest (which she lacked even the
      delicacy to conceal) in a creature like Jimson! He could conceive her
      asking Jimson to have tea with her! And it was for a girl like this that a
      man like Gideon&mdash;Down, manly heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by a sound that sent him whipping behind the door in a
      trice. Miss Hazeltine had stepped on board the houseboat. Her sketch was
      promising; judging from the stillness, she supposed Jimson not yet come;
      and she had decided to seize occasion and complete the work of art. Down
      she sat therefore in the bow, produced her block and water-colours, and
      was soon singing over (what used to be called) the ladylike
      accomplishment. Now and then indeed her song was interrupted, as she
      searched in her memory for some of the odious little receipts by means of
      which the game is practised&mdash;or used to be practised in the brave
      days of old; they say the world, and those ornaments of the world, young
      ladies, are become more sophisticated now; but Julia had probably studied
      under Pitman, and she stood firm in the old ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon, meanwhile, stood behind the door, afraid to move, afraid to
      breathe, afraid to think of what must follow, racked by confinement and
      borne to the ground with tedium. This particular phase, he felt with
      gratitude, could not last for ever; whatever impended (even the gallows,
      he bitterly and perhaps erroneously reflected) could not fail to be a
      relief. To calculate cubes occurred to him as an ingenious and even
      profitable refuge from distressing thoughts, and he threw his manhood into
      that dreary exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, then, were these two young persons occupied&mdash;Gideon attacking
      the perfect number with resolution; Julia vigorously stippling incongruous
      colours on her block, when Providence dispatched into these waters a
      steam-launch asthmatically panting up the Thames. All along the banks the
      water swelled and fell, and the reeds rustled. The houseboat itself, that
      ancient stationary creature, became suddenly imbued with life, and rolled
      briskly at her moorings, like a sea-going ship when she begins to smell
      the harbour bar. The wash had nearly died away, and the quick panting of
      the launch sounded already faint and far off, when Gideon was startled by
      a cry from Julia. Peering through the window, he beheld her staring
      disconsolately downstream at the fast-vanishing canoe. The barrister
      (whatever were his faults) displayed on this occasion a promptitude worthy
      of his hero, Robert Skill; with one effort of his mind he foresaw what was
      about to follow; with one movement of his body he dropped to the floor and
      crawled under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia, on her part, was not yet alive to her position. She saw she had
      lost the canoe, and she looked forward with something less than avidity to
      her next interview with Mr Bloomfield; but she had no idea that she was
      imprisoned, for she knew of the plank bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made the circuit of the house, and found the door open and the bridge
      withdrawn. It was plain, then, that Jimson must have come; plain, too,
      that he must be on board. He must be a very shy man to have suffered this
      invasion of his residence, and made no sign; and her courage rose higher
      at the thought. He must come now, she must force him from his privacy, for
      the plank was too heavy for her single strength; so she tapped upon the
      open door. Then she tapped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Jimson,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;Mr Jimson! here, come!&mdash;you must come, you
      know, sooner or later, for I can&rsquo;t get off without you. O, don&rsquo;t be so
      exceedingly silly! O, please, come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he is here he must be mad,&rsquo; she thought, with a little fear. And the
      next moment she remembered he had probably gone aboard like herself in a
      boat. In that case she might as well see the houseboat, and she pushed
      open the door and stepped in. Under the table, where he lay smothered with
      dust, Gideon&rsquo;s heart stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the remains of Jimson&rsquo;s lunch. &lsquo;He likes rather nice things to
      eat,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;O, I am sure he is quite a delightful man. I wonder if
      he is as good-looking as Mr Forsyth. Mrs Jimson&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe it
      sounds as nice as Mrs Forsyth; but then &ldquo;Gideon&rdquo; is so really odious! And
      here is some of his music too; this is delightful. Orange Pekoe&mdash;O,
      that&rsquo;s what he meant by some kind of tea.&rsquo; And she trilled with laughter.
      &lsquo;Adagio molto espressivo, sempre legato,&rsquo; she read next. (For the literary
      part of a composer&rsquo;s business Gideon was well equipped.) &lsquo;How very strange
      to have all these directions, and only three or four notes! O, here&rsquo;s
      another with some more. Andante patetico.&rsquo; And she began to glance over
      the music. &lsquo;O dear me,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;he must be terribly modern! It all
      seems discords to me. Let&rsquo;s try the air. It is very strange, it seems
      familiar.&rsquo; She began to sing it, and suddenly broke off with laughter.
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tommy make room for your Uncle!&rdquo;&rsquo; she cried aloud, so that the
      soul of Gideon was filled with bitterness. &lsquo;Andante patetico, indeed! The
      man must be a mere impostor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And just at this moment there came a confused, scuffling sound from
      underneath the table; a strange note, like that of a barn-door fowl,
      ushered in a most explosive sneeze; the head of the sufferer was at the
      same time brought smartly in contact with the boards above; and the sneeze
      was followed by a hollow groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia fled to the door, and there, with the salutary instinct of the
      brave, turned and faced the danger. There was no pursuit. The sounds
      continued; below the table a crouching figure was indistinctly to be seen
      jostled by the throes of a sneezing-fit; and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; thought Julia, &lsquo;this is most unusual behaviour. He cannot be a
      man of the world!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the dust of years had been disturbed by the young barrister&rsquo;s
      convulsions; and the sneezing-fit was succeeded by a passionate access of
      coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia began to feel a certain interest. &lsquo;I am afraid you are really quite
      ill,&rsquo; she said, drawing a little nearer. &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t let me put you out,
      and do not stay under that table, Mr Jimson. Indeed it cannot be good for
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Jimson only answered by a distressing cough; and the next moment the
      girl was on her knees, and their faces had almost knocked together under
      the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, my gracious goodness!&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Hazeltine, and sprang to her
      feet. &lsquo;Mr Forsyth gone mad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not mad,&rsquo; said the gentleman ruefully, extricating himself from his
      position. &lsquo;Dearest. Miss Hazeltine, I vow to you upon my knees I am not
      mad!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not!&rsquo; she cried, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that to a superficial eye my conduct may appear
      unconventional.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you are not mad, it was no conduct at all,&rsquo; cried the girl, with a
      flash of colour, &lsquo;and showed you did not care one penny for my feelings!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the very devil and all. I know&mdash;I admit that,&rsquo; cried Gideon,
      with a great effort of manly candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was abominable conduct!&rsquo; said Julia, with energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it must have shaken your esteem,&rsquo; said the barrister. &lsquo;But,
      dearest Miss Hazeltine, I beg of you to hear me out; my behaviour, strange
      as it may seem, is not unsusceptible of explanation; and I positively
      cannot and will not consent to continue to try to exist without&mdash;without
      the esteem of one whom I admire&mdash;the moment is ill chosen, I am well
      aware of that; but I repeat the expression&mdash;one whom I admire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A touch of amusement appeared on Miss Hazeltine&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said
      she, &lsquo;come out of this dreadfully cold place, and let us sit down on
      deck.&rsquo; The barrister dolefully followed her. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said she, making
      herself comfortable against the end of the house, &lsquo;go on. I will hear you
      out.&rsquo; And then, seeing him stand before her with so much obvious disrelish
      to the task, she was suddenly overcome with laughter. Julia&rsquo;s laugh was a
      thing to ravish lovers; she rolled her mirthful descant with the freedom
      and the melody of a blackbird&rsquo;s song upon the river, and repeated by the
      echoes of the farther bank. It seemed a thing in its own place and a sound
      native to the open air. There was only one creature who heard it without
      joy, and that was her unfortunate admirer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Hazeltine,&rsquo; he said, in a voice that tottered with annoyance, &lsquo;I
      speak as your sincere well-wisher, but this can only be called levity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Julia made great eyes at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t withdraw the word,&rsquo; he said: &lsquo;already the freedom with which I
      heard you hobnobbing with a boatman gave me exquisite pain. Then there was
      a want of reserve about Jimson&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Jimson appears to be yourself,&rsquo; objected Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am far from denying that,&rsquo; cried the barrister, &lsquo;but you did not know
      it at the time. What could Jimson be to you? Who was Jimson? Miss
      Hazeltine, it cut me to the heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really this seems to me to be very silly,&rsquo; returned Julia, with severe
      decision. &lsquo;You have behaved in the most extraordinary manner; you pretend
      you are able to explain your conduct, and instead of doing so you begin to
      attack me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am well aware of that,&rsquo; replied Gideon. &lsquo;I&mdash;I will make a clean
      breast of it. When you know all the circumstances you will be able to
      excuse me.
    </p>
    <p>
      And sitting down beside her on the deck, he poured forth his miserable
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, Mr Forsyth,&rsquo; she cried, when he had done, &lsquo;I am&mdash;so&mdash;sorry!
      wish I hadn&rsquo;t laughed at you&mdash;only you know you really were so
      exceedingly funny. But I wish I hadn&rsquo;t, and I wouldn&rsquo;t either if I had
      only known.&rsquo; And she gave him her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon kept it in his own. &lsquo;You do not think the worse of me for this?&rsquo; he
      asked tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you have been so silly and got into such dreadful trouble? you
      poor boy, no!&rsquo; cried Julia; and, in the warmth of the moment, reached him
      her other hand; &lsquo;you may count on me,&rsquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really?&rsquo; said Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really and really!&rsquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do then, and I will,&rsquo; cried the young man. &lsquo;I admit the moment is not
      well chosen; but I have no friends&mdash;to speak of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more have I,&rsquo; said Julia. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s perhaps time you
      gave me back my hands?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;La ci darem la mano,&rsquo; said the barrister, &lsquo;the merest moment more! I have
      so few friends,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought it was considered such a bad account of a young man to have no
      friends,&rsquo; observed Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, but I have crowds of FRIENDS!&rsquo; cried Gideon. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean.
      I feel the moment is ill chosen; but O, Julia, if you could only see
      yourself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Forsyth&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t call me by that beastly name!&rsquo; cried the youth. &lsquo;Call me Gideon!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, never that,&rsquo; from Julia. &lsquo;Besides, we have known each other such a
      short time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; protested Gideon. &lsquo;We met at Bournemouth ever so long ago. I
      never forgot you since. Say you never forgot me. Say you never forgot me,
      and call me Gideon!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t this rather&mdash;a want of reserve about Jimson?&rsquo; enquired the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I know I am an ass,&rsquo; cried the barrister, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t care a
      halfpenny! I know I&rsquo;m an ass, and you may laugh at me to your heart&rsquo;s
      delight.&rsquo; And as Julia&rsquo;s lips opened with a smile, he once more dropped
      into music. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the Land of Cherry Isle!&rsquo; he sang, courting her with
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like an opera,&rsquo; said Julia, rather faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What should it be?&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;Am I not Jimson? It would be strange if
      I did not serenade my love. O yes, I mean the word, my Julia; and I mean
      to win you. I am in dreadful trouble, and I have not a penny of my own,
      and I have cut the silliest figure; and yet I mean to win you, Julia. Look
      at me, if you can, and tell me no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him; and whatever her eyes may have told him, it is to be
      supposed he took a pleasure in the message, for he read it a long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Uncle Ned will give us some money to go on upon in the meanwhile,&rsquo; he
      said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I call that cool!&rsquo; said a cheerful voice at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon and Julia sprang apart with wonderful alacrity; the latter annoyed
      to observe that although they had never moved since they sat down, they
      were now quite close together; both presenting faces of a very heightened
      colour to the eyes of Mr Edward Hugh Bloomfield. That gentleman, coming up
      the river in his boat, had captured the truant canoe, and divining what
      had happened, had thought to steal a march upon Miss Hazeltine at her
      sketch. He had unexpectedly brought down two birds with one stone; and as
      he looked upon the pair of flushed and breathless culprits, the pleasant
      human instinct of the matchmaker softened his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I call that cool,&rsquo; he repeated; &lsquo;you seem to count very securely
      upon Uncle Ned. But look here, Gid, I thought I had told you to keep
      away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To keep away from Maidenhead,&rsquo; replied Gid. &lsquo;But how should I expect to
      find you here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something in that,&rsquo; Mr Bloomfield admitted. &lsquo;You see I thought
      it better that even you should be ignorant of my address; those rascals,
      the Finsburys, would have wormed it out of you. And just to put them off
      the scent I hoisted these abominable colours. But that is not all, Gid;
      you promised me to work, and here I find you playing the fool at Padwick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, Mr Bloomfield, you must not be hard on Mr Forsyth,&rsquo; said Julia.
      &lsquo;Poor boy, he is in dreadful straits.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this, Gid?&rsquo; enquired the uncle. &lsquo;Have you been fighting? or is it
      a bill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These, in the opinion of the Squirradical, were the two misfortunes
      incident to gentlemen; and indeed both were culled from his own career. He
      had once put his name (as a matter of form) on a friend&rsquo;s paper; it had
      cost him a cool thousand; and the friend had gone about with the fear of
      death upon him ever since, and never turned a corner without scouting in
      front of him for Mr Bloomfield and the oaken staff. As for fighting, the
      Squirradical was always on the brink of it; and once, when (in the
      character of president of a Radical club) he had cleared out the hall of
      his opponents, things had gone even further. Mr Holtum, the Conservative
      candidate, who lay so long on the bed of sickness, was prepared to swear
      to Mr Bloomfield. &lsquo;I will swear to it in any court&mdash;it was the hand
      of that brute that struck me down,&rsquo; he was reported to have said; and when
      he was thought to be sinking, it was known that he had made an ante-mortem
      statement in that sense. It was a cheerful day for the Squirradical when
      Holtum was restored to his brewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s much worse than that,&rsquo; said Gideon; &lsquo;a combination of circumstances
      really providentially unjust&mdash;a&mdash;in fact, a syndicate of
      murderers seem to have perceived my latent ability to rid them of the
      traces of their crime. It&rsquo;s a legal study after all, you see!&rsquo; And with
      these words, Gideon, for the second time that day, began to describe the
      adventures of the Broadwood Grand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must write to The Times,&rsquo; cried Mr Bloomfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you want to get me disbarred?&rsquo; asked Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disbarred! Come, it can&rsquo;t be as bad as that,&rsquo; said his uncle. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
      good, honest, Liberal Government that&rsquo;s in, and they would certainly move
      at my request. Thank God, the days of Tory jobbery are at an end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do, Uncle Ned,&rsquo; said Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re not mad enough,&rsquo; cried Mr Bloomfield, &lsquo;to persist in trying to
      dispose of it yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no other path open to me,&rsquo; said Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not common sense, and I will not hear of it,&rsquo; cried Mr Bloomfield.
      &lsquo;I command you, positively, Gid, to desist from this criminal
      interference.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, then, I hand it over to you,&rsquo; said Gideon, &lsquo;and you can do
      what you like with the dead body.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forbid!&rsquo; ejaculated the president of the Radical Club, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have
      nothing to do with it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you must allow me to do the best I can,&rsquo; returned his nephew.
      &lsquo;Believe me, I have a distinct talent for this sort of difficulty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We might forward it to that pest-house, the Conservative Club,&rsquo; observed
      Mr Bloomfield. &lsquo;It might damage them in the eyes of their constituents;
      and it could be profitably worked up in the local journal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you see any political capital in the thing,&rsquo; said Gideon, &lsquo;you may
      have it for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, Gid&mdash;no, no, I thought you might. I will have no hand in the
      thing. On reflection, it&rsquo;s highly undesirable that either I or Miss
      Hazeltine should linger here. We might be observed,&rsquo; said the president,
      looking up and down the river; &lsquo;and in my public position the consequences
      would be painful for the party. And, at any rate, it&rsquo;s dinner-time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Gideon, plunging for his watch. &lsquo;And so it is! Great heaven,
      the piano should have been here hours ago!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bloomfield was clambering back into his boat; but at these words he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it arrive myself at the station; I hired a carrier man; he had a
      round to make, but he was to be here by four at the latest,&rsquo; cried the
      barrister. &lsquo;No doubt the piano is open, and the body found.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must fly at once,&rsquo; cried Mr Bloomfield, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the only manly step.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But suppose it&rsquo;s all right?&rsquo; wailed Gideon. &lsquo;Suppose the piano comes, and
      I am not here to receive it? I shall have hanged myself by my cowardice.
      No, Uncle Ned, enquiries must be made in Padwick; I dare not go, of
      course; but you may&mdash;you could hang about the police office, don&rsquo;t
      you see?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Gid&mdash;no, my dear nephew,&rsquo; said Mr Bloomfield, with the voice of
      one on the rack. &lsquo;I regard you with the most sacred affection; and I thank
      God I am an Englishman&mdash;and all that. But not&mdash;not the police,
      Gid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you desert me?&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;Say it plainly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Far from it! far from it!&rsquo; protested Mr Bloomfield. &lsquo;I only propose
      caution. Common sense, Gid, should always be an Englishman&rsquo;s guide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you let me speak?&rsquo; said Julia. &lsquo;I think Gideon had better leave this
      dreadful houseboat, and wait among the willows over there. If the piano
      comes, then he could step out and take it in; and if the police come, he
      could slip into our houseboat, and there needn&rsquo;t be any more Jimson at
      all. He could go to bed, and we could burn his clothes (couldn&rsquo;t we?) in
      the steam-launch; and then really it seems as if it would be all right. Mr
      Bloomfield is so respectable, you know, and such a leading character, it
      would be quite impossible even to fancy that he could be mixed up with
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This young lady has strong common sense,&rsquo; said the Squirradical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m at all a fool,&rsquo; said Julia, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what if neither of them come?&rsquo; asked Gideon; &lsquo;what shall I do then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why then,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you had better go down to the village after dark;
      and I can go with you, and then I am sure you could never be suspected;
      and even if you were, I could tell them it was altogether a mistake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not permit that&mdash;I will not suffer Miss Hazeltine to go,&rsquo; 
      cried Mr Bloomfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; asked Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bloomfield had not the least desire to tell her why, for it was simply
      a craven fear of being drawn himself into the imbroglio; but with the
      usual tactics of a man who is ashamed of himself, he took the high hand.
      &lsquo;God forbid, my dear Miss Hazeltine, that I should dictate to a lady on
      the question of propriety&mdash;&rsquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, is that all?&rsquo; interrupted Julia. &lsquo;Then we must go all three.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Caught!&rsquo; thought the Squirradical.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. Positively the Last Appearance of the Broadwood Grand
    </h2>
    <p>
      England is supposed to be unmusical; but without dwelling on the patronage
      extended to the organ-grinder, without seeking to found any argument on
      the prevalence of the jew&rsquo;s trump, there is surely one instrument that may
      be said to be national in the fullest acceptance of the word. The herdboy
      in the broom, already musical in the days of Father Chaucer, startles (and
      perhaps pains) the lark with this exiguous pipe; and in the hands of the
      skilled bricklayer,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The thing becomes a trumpet, whence he blows&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      (as a general rule) either &lsquo;The British Grenadiers&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cherry Ripe&rsquo;. The
      latter air is indeed the shibboleth and diploma piece of the penny
      whistler; I hazard a guess it was originally composed for this instrument.
      It is singular enough that a man should be able to gain a livelihood, or
      even to tide over a period of unemployment, by the display of his
      proficiency upon the penny whistle; still more so, that the professional
      should almost invariably confine himself to &lsquo;Cherry Ripe&rsquo;. But indeed,
      singularities surround the subject, thick like blackberries. Why, for
      instance, should the pipe be called a penny whistle? I think no one ever
      bought it for a penny. Why should the alternative name be tin whistle? I
      am grossly deceived if it be made of tin. Lastly, in what deaf catacomb,
      in what earless desert, does the beginner pass the excruciating interval
      of his apprenticeship? We have all heard people learning the piano, the
      fiddle, and the cornet; but the young of the penny whistler (like that of
      the salmon) is occult from observation; he is never heard until
      proficient; and providence (perhaps alarmed by the works of Mr Mallock)
      defends human hearing from his first attempts upon the upper octave.
    </p>
    <p>
      A really noteworthy thing was taking place in a green lane, not far from
      Padwick. On the bench of a carrier&rsquo;s cart there sat a tow-headed, lanky,
      modest-looking youth; the reins were on his lap; the whip lay behind him
      in the interior of the cart; the horse proceeded without guidance or
      encouragement; the carrier (or the carrier&rsquo;s man), rapt into a higher
      sphere than that of his daily occupations, his looks dwelling on the
      skies, devoted himself wholly to a brand-new D penny whistle, whence he
      diffidently endeavoured to elicit that pleasing melody &lsquo;The Ploughboy&rsquo;. To
      any observant person who should have chanced to saunter in that lane, the
      hour would have been thrilling. &lsquo;Here at last,&rsquo; he would have said, &lsquo;is
      the beginner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tow-headed youth (whose name was Harker) had just encored himself for
      the nineteenth time, when he was struck into the extreme of confusion by
      the discovery that he was not alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you have it!&rsquo; cried a manly voice from the side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s as good as I want to hear. Perhaps a leetle oilier in the run,&rsquo; 
      the voice suggested, with meditative gusto. &lsquo;Give it us again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Harker glanced, from the depths of his humiliation, at the speaker. He
      beheld a powerful, sun-brown, clean-shaven fellow, about forty years of
      age, striding beside the cart with a non-commissioned military bearing,
      and (as he strode) spinning in the air a cane. The fellow&rsquo;s clothes were
      very bad, but he looked clean and self-reliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only a beginner,&rsquo; gasped the blushing Harker, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anybody
      could hear me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I like that!&rsquo; returned the other. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty old beginner.
      Come, I&rsquo;ll give you a lead myself. Give us a seat here beside you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment the military gentleman was perched on the cart, pipe in
      hand. He gave the instrument a knowing rattle on the shaft, mouthed it,
      appeared to commune for a moment with the muse, and dashed into &lsquo;The girl
      I left behind me&rsquo;. He was a great, rather than a fine, performer; he
      lacked the bird-like richness; he could scarce have extracted all the
      honey out of &lsquo;Cherry Ripe&rsquo;; he did not fear&mdash;he even ostentatiously
      displayed and seemed to revel in he shrillness of the instrument; but in
      fire, speed, precision, evenness, and fluency; in linked agility of jimmy&mdash;a
      technical expression, by your leave, answering to warblers on the bagpipe;
      and perhaps, above all, in that inspiring side-glance of the eye, with
      which he followed the effect and (as by a human appeal) eked out the
      insufficiency of his performance: in these, the fellow stood without a
      rival. Harker listened: &lsquo;The girl I left behind me&rsquo; filled him with
      despair; &lsquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s Joy&rsquo; carried him beyond jealousy into generous
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Turn about,&rsquo; said the military gentleman, offering the pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, not after you!&rsquo; cried Harker; &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a professional.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said his companion; &lsquo;an amatyure like yourself. That&rsquo;s one style of
      play, yours is the other, and I like it best. But I began when I was a
      boy, you see, before my taste was formed. When you&rsquo;re my age you&rsquo;ll play
      that thing like a cornet-a-piston. Give us that air again; how does it
      go?&rsquo; and he affected to endeavour to recall &lsquo;The Ploughboy&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A timid, insane hope sprang in the breast of Harker. Was it possible? Was
      there something in his playing? It had, indeed, seemed to him at times as
      if he got a kind of a richness out of it. Was he a genius? Meantime the
      military gentleman stumbled over the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the unhappy Harker, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s not quite it. It goes this way&mdash;just
      to show you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And, taking the pipe between his lips, he sealed his doom. When he had
      played the air, and then a second time, and a third; when the military
      gentleman had tried it once more, and once more failed; when it became
      clear to Harker that he, the blushing debutant, was actually giving a
      lesson to this full-grown flutist&mdash;and the flutist under his care was
      not very brilliantly progressing&mdash;how am I to tell what floods of
      glory brightened the autumnal countryside; how, unless the reader were an
      amateur himself, describe the heights of idiotic vanity to which the
      carrier climbed? One significant fact shall paint the situation:
      thenceforth it was Harker who played, and the military gentleman listened
      and approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he listened, however, he did not forget the habit of soldierly
      precaution, looking both behind and before. He looked behind and computed
      the value of the carrier&rsquo;s load, divining the contents of the brown-paper
      parcels and the portly hamper, and briefly setting down the grand piano in
      the brand-new piano-case as &lsquo;difficult to get rid of&rsquo;. He looked before,
      and spied at the corner of the green lane a little country public-house
      embowered in roses. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have a shy at it,&rsquo; concluded the military
      gentleman, and roundly proposed a glass. &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a drinking man,&rsquo; 
      said Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, now,&rsquo; cut in the other, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you who I am: I&rsquo;m
      Colour-Sergeant Brand of the Blankth. That&rsquo;ll tell you if I&rsquo;m a drinking
      man or not.&rsquo; It might and it might not, thus a Greek chorus would have
      intervened, and gone on to point out how very far it fell short of telling
      why the sergeant was tramping a country lane in tatters; or even to argue
      that he must have pretermitted some while ago his labours for the general
      defence, and (in the interval) possibly turned his attention to oakum. But
      there was no Greek chorus present; and the man of war went on to contend
      that drinking was one thing and a friendly glass another.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Blue Lion, which was the name of the country public-house,
      Colour-Sergeant Brand introduced his new friend, Mr Harker, to a number of
      ingenious mixtures, calculated to prevent the approaches of intoxication.
      These he explained to be &lsquo;rekisite&rsquo; in the service, so that a
      self-respecting officer should always appear upon parade in a condition
      honourable to his corps. The most efficacious of these devices was to lace
      a pint of mild ale with twopenceworth of London gin. I am pleased to hand
      in this recipe to the discerning reader, who may find it useful even in
      civil station; for its effect upon Mr Harker was revolutionary. He must be
      helped on board his own waggon, where he proceeded to display a spirit
      entirely given over to mirth and music, alternately hooting with laughter,
      to which the sergeant hastened to bear chorus, and incoherently tootling
      on the pipe. The man of war, meantime, unostentatiously possessed himself
      of the reins. It was plain he had a taste for the secluded beauties of an
      English landscape; for the cart, although it wandered under his guidance
      for some time, was never observed to issue on the dusty highway,
      journeying between hedge and ditch, and for the most part under
      overhanging boughs. It was plain, besides, he had an eye to the true
      interests of Mr Harker; for though the cart drew up more than once at the
      doors of public-houses, it was only the sergeant who set foot to ground,
      and, being equipped himself with a quart bottle, once more proceeded on
      his rural drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give any idea of the complexity of the sergeant&rsquo;s course, a map of that
      part of Middlesex would be required, and my publisher is averse from the
      expense. Suffice it, that a little after the night had closed, the cart
      was brought to a standstill in a woody road; where the sergeant lifted
      from among the parcels, and tenderly deposited upon the wayside, the
      inanimate form of Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you come-to before daylight,&rsquo; thought the sergeant, &lsquo;I shall be
      surprised for one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      From the various pockets of the slumbering carrier he gently collected the
      sum of seventeen shillings and eightpence sterling; and, getting once more
      into the cart, drove thoughtfully away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I was exactly sure of where I was, it would be a good job,&rsquo; he
      reflected. &lsquo;Anyway, here&rsquo;s a corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned it, and found himself upon the riverside. A little above him the
      lights of a houseboat shone cheerfully; and already close at hand, so
      close that it was impossible to avoid their notice, three persons, a lady
      and two gentlemen, were deliberately drawing near. The sergeant put his
      trust in the convenient darkness of the night, and drove on to meet them.
      One of the gentlemen, who was of a portly figure, walked in the midst of
      the fairway, and presently held up a staff by way of signal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My man, have you seen anything of a carrier&rsquo;s cart?&rsquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark as it was, it seemed to the sergeant as though the slimmer of the two
      gentlemen had made a motion to prevent the other speaking, and (finding
      himself too late) had skipped aside with some alacrity. At another season,
      Sergeant Brand would have paid more attention to the fact; but he was then
      immersed in the perils of his own predicament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A carrier&rsquo;s cart?&rsquo; said he, with a perceptible uncertainty of voice. &lsquo;No,
      sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the portly gentleman, and stood aside to let the sergeant pass.
      The lady appeared to bend forward and study the cart with every mark of
      sharpened curiosity, the slimmer gentleman still keeping in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what the devil they would be at,&rsquo; thought Sergeant Brand; and,
      looking fearfully back, he saw the trio standing together in the midst of
      the way, like folk consulting. The bravest of military heroes are not
      always equal to themselves as to their reputation; and fear, on some
      singular provocation, will find a lodgment in the most unfamiliar bosom.
      The word &lsquo;detective&rsquo; might have been heard to gurgle in the sergeant&rsquo;s
      throat; and vigorously applying the whip, he fled up the riverside road to
      Great Haverham, at the gallop of the carrier&rsquo;s horse. The lights of the
      houseboat flashed upon the flying waggon as it passed; the beat of hoofs
      and the rattle of the vehicle gradually coalesced and died away; and
      presently, to the trio on the riverside, silence had redescended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the most extraordinary thing,&rsquo; cried the slimmer of the two
      gentlemen, &lsquo;but that&rsquo;s the cart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I know I saw a piano,&rsquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, it&rsquo;s the cart, certainly; and the extraordinary thing is, it&rsquo;s not the
      man,&rsquo; added the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be the man, Gid, it must be,&rsquo; said the portly one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, why is he running away?&rsquo; asked Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His horse bolted, I suppose,&rsquo; said the Squirradical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! I heard the whip going like a flail,&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;It simply
      defies the human reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rsquo; broke in the girl, &lsquo;he came round that corner. Suppose we
      went and&mdash;what do you call it in books?&mdash;followed his trail?
      There may be a house there, or somebody who saw him, or something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, suppose we did, for the fun of the thing,&rsquo; said Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fun of the thing (it would appear) consisted in the extremely close
      juxtaposition of himself and Miss Hazeltine. To Uncle Ned, who was
      excluded from these simple pleasures, the excursion appeared hopeless from
      the first; and when a fresh perspective of darkness opened up, dimly
      contained between park palings on the one side and a hedge and ditch upon
      the other, the whole without the smallest signal of human habitation, the
      Squirradical drew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a wild-goose chase,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the cessation of the footfalls, another sound smote upon their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; cried Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; said Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squirradical had his stick presented like a sword. &lsquo;Gid,&rsquo; he began,
      &lsquo;Gid, I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Mr Forsyth!&rsquo; cried the girl. &lsquo;O don&rsquo;t go forward, you don&rsquo;t know what
      it might be&mdash;it might be something perfectly horrid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be the devil itself,&rsquo; said Gideon, disengaging himself, &lsquo;but I am
      going to see it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be rash, Gid,&rsquo; cried his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrister drew near to the sound, which was certainly of a portentous
      character. In quality it appeared to blend the strains of the cow, the
      fog-horn, and the mosquito; and the startling manner of its enunciation
      added incalculably to its terrors. A dark object, not unlike the human
      form divine, appeared on the brink of the ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a man,&rsquo; said Gideon, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only a man; he seems to be asleep and
      snoring. Hullo,&rsquo; he added, a moment after, &lsquo;there must be something wrong
      with him, he won&rsquo;t waken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gideon produced his vestas, struck one, and by its light recognized the
      tow head of Harker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the man,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;as drunk as Belial. I see the whole story&rsquo;;
      and to his two companions, who had now ventured to rejoin him, he set
      forth a theory of the divorce between the carrier and his cart, which was
      not unlike the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drunken brute!&rsquo; said Uncle Ned, &lsquo;let&rsquo;s get him to a pump and give him
      what he deserves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all!&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;It is highly undesirable he should see us
      together; and really, do you know, I am very much obliged to him, for this
      is about the luckiest thing that could have possibly occurred. It seems to
      me&mdash;Uncle Ned, I declare to heaven it seems to me&mdash;I&rsquo;m clear of
      it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clear of what?&rsquo; asked the Squirradical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The whole affair!&rsquo; cried Gideon. &lsquo;That man has been ass enough to steal
      the cart and the dead body; what he hopes to do with it I neither know nor
      care. My hands are free, Jimson ceases; down with Jimson. Shake hands with
      me, Uncle Ned&mdash;Julia, darling girl, Julia, I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gideon, Gideon!&rsquo; said his uncle. &lsquo;O, it&rsquo;s all right, uncle, when we&rsquo;re
      going to be married so soon,&rsquo; said Gideon. &lsquo;You know you said so yourself
      in the houseboat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I?&rsquo; said Uncle Ned; &lsquo;I am certain I said no such thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Appeal to him, tell him he did, get on his soft side,&rsquo; cried Gideon.
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a real brick if you get on his soft side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Mr Bloomfield,&rsquo; said Julia, &lsquo;I know Gideon will be such a very good
      boy, and he has promised me to do such a lot of law, and I will see that
      he does too. And you know it is so very steadying to young men, everybody
      admits that; though, of course, I know I have no money, Mr Bloomfield,&rsquo; 
      she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear young lady, as this rapscallion told you today on the boat, Uncle
      Ned has plenty,&rsquo; said the Squirradical, &lsquo;and I can never forget that you
      have been shamefully defrauded. So as there&rsquo;s nobody looking, you had
      better give your Uncle Ned a kiss. There, you rogue,&rsquo; resumed Mr
      Bloomfield, when the ceremony had been daintily performed, &lsquo;this very
      pretty young lady is yours, and a vast deal more than you deserve. But
      now, let us get back to the houseboat, get up steam on the launch, and
      away back to town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the thing!&rsquo; cried Gideon; &lsquo;and tomorrow there will be no
      houseboat, and no Jimson, and no carrier&rsquo;s cart, and no piano; and when
      Harker awakes on the ditchside, he may tell himself the whole affair has
      been a dream.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said Uncle Ned, &lsquo;but there&rsquo;s another man who will have a different
      awakening. That fellow in the cart will find he has been too clever by
      half.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncle Ned and Julia,&rsquo; said Gideon, &lsquo;I am as happy as the King of Tartary,
      my heart is like a threepenny-bit, my heels are like feathers; I am out of
      all my troubles, Julia&rsquo;s hand is in mine. Is this a time for anything but
      handsome sentiments? Why, there&rsquo;s not room in me for anything that&rsquo;s not
      angelic! And when I think of that poor unhappy devil in the cart, I stand
      here in the night and cry with a single heart God help him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen,&rsquo; said Uncle Ned.

      CHAPTER XIII. The Tribulations of Morris: Part the Second
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a really polite age of literature I would have scorned to cast my eye
      again on the contortions of Morris. But the study is in the spirit of the
      day; it presents, besides, features of a high, almost a repulsive,
      morality; and if it should prove the means of preventing any respectable
      and inexperienced gentleman from plunging light-heartedly into crime, even
      political crime, this work will not have been penned in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose on the morrow of his night with Michael, rose from the leaden
      slumber of distress, to find his hand tremulous, his eyes closed with
      rheum, his throat parched, and his digestion obviously paralysed. &lsquo;Lord
      knows it&rsquo;s not from eating!&rsquo; Morris thought; and as he dressed he
      reconsidered his position under several heads. Nothing will so well depict
      the troubled seas in which he was now voyaging as a review of these
      various anxieties. I have thrown them (for the reader&rsquo;s convenience) into
      a certain order; but in the mind of one poor human equal they whirled
      together like the dust of hurricanes. With the same obliging
      preoccupation, I have put a name to each of his distresses; and it will be
      observed with pity that every individual item would have graced and
      commended the cover of a railway novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiety the First: Where is the Body? or, The Mystery of Bent Pitman. It
      was now manifestly plain that Bent Pitman (as was to be looked for from
      his ominous appellation) belonged to the darker order of the criminal
      class. An honest man would not have cashed the bill; a humane man would
      not have accepted in silence the tragic contents of the water-butt; a man,
      who was not already up to the hilts in gore, would have lacked the means
      of secretly disposing them. This process of reasoning left a horrid image
      of the monster, Pitman. Doubtless he had long ago disposed of the body&mdash;dropping
      it through a trapdoor in his back kitchen, Morris supposed, with some hazy
      recollection of a picture in a penny dreadful; and doubtless the man now
      lived in wanton splendour on the proceeds of the bill. So far, all was
      peace. But with the profligate habits of a man like Bent Pitman (who was
      no doubt a hunchback in the bargain), eight hundred pounds could be easily
      melted in a week. When they were gone, what would he be likely to do next?
      A hell-like voice in Morris&rsquo;s own bosom gave the answer: &lsquo;Blackmail me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiety the Second: The Fraud of the Tontine; or, Is my Uncle dead? This,
      on which all Morris&rsquo;s hopes depended, was yet a question. He had tried to
      bully Teena; he had tried to bribe her; and nothing came of it. He had his
      moral conviction still; but you cannot blackmail a sharp lawyer on a moral
      conviction. And besides, since his interview with Michael, the idea wore a
      less attractive countenance. Was Michael the man to be blackmailed? and
      was Morris the man to do it? Grave considerations. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m
      afraid of him,&rsquo; Morris so far condescended to reassure himself; &lsquo;but I
      must be very certain of my ground, and the deuce of it is, I see no way.
      How unlike is life to novels! I wouldn&rsquo;t have even begun this business in
      a novel, but what I&rsquo;d have met a dark, slouching fellow in the Oxford
      Road, who&rsquo;d have become my accomplice, and known all about how to do it,
      and probably broken into Michael&rsquo;s house at night and found nothing but a
      waxwork image; and then blackmailed or murdered me. But here, in real
      life, I might walk the streets till I dropped dead, and none of the
      criminal classes would look near me. Though, to be sure, there is always
      Pitman,&rsquo; he added thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiety the Third: The Cottage at Browndean; or, The Underpaid Accomplice.
      For he had an accomplice, and that accomplice was blooming unseen in a
      damp cottage in Hampshire with empty pockets. What could be done about
      that? He really ought to have sent him something; if it was only a
      post-office order for five bob, enough to prove that he was kept in mind,
      enough to keep him in hope, beer, and tobacco. &lsquo;But what would you have?&rsquo; 
      thought Morris; and ruefully poured into his hand a half-crown, a florin,
      and eightpence in small change. For a man in Morris&rsquo;s position, at war
      with all society, and conducting, with the hand of inexperience, a widely
      ramified intrigue, the sum was already a derision. John would have to be
      doing; no mistake of that. &lsquo;But then,&rsquo; asked the hell-like voice, &lsquo;how
      long is John likely to stand it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxiety the Fourth: The Leather Business; or, The Shutters at Last: a Tale
      of the City. On this head Morris had no news. He had not yet dared to
      visit the family concern; yet he knew he must delay no longer, and if
      anything had been wanted to sharpen this conviction, Michael&rsquo;s references
      of the night before rang ambiguously in his ear. Well and good. To visit
      the city might be indispensable; but what was he to do when he was there?
      He had no right to sign in his own name; and, with all the will in the
      world, he seemed to lack the art of signing with his uncle&rsquo;s. Under these
      circumstances, Morris could do nothing to procrastinate the crash; and,
      when it came, when prying eyes began to be applied to every joint of his
      behaviour, two questions could not fail to be addressed, sooner or later,
      to a speechless and perspiring insolvent. Where is Mr Joseph Finsbury? and
      how about your visit to the bank? Questions, how easy to put!&mdash;ye
      gods, how impossible to answer! The man to whom they should be addressed
      went certainly to gaol, and&mdash;eh! what was this?&mdash;possibly to the
      gallows. Morris was trying to shave when this idea struck him, and he laid
      the razor down. Here (in Michael&rsquo;s words) was the total disappearance of a
      valuable uncle; here was a time of inexplicable conduct on the part of a
      nephew who had been in bad blood with the old man any time these seven
      years; what a chance for a judicial blunder! &lsquo;But no,&rsquo; thought Morris,
      &lsquo;they cannot, they dare not, make it murder. Not that. But honestly, and
      speaking as a man to a man, I don&rsquo;t see any other crime in the calendar
      (except arson) that I don&rsquo;t seem somehow to have committed. And yet I&rsquo;m a
      perfectly respectable man, and wished nothing but my due. Law is a pretty
      business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this conclusion firmly seated in his mind, Morris Finsbury descended
      to the hall of the house in John Street, still half-shaven. There was a
      letter in the box; he knew the handwriting: John at last!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I think I might have been spared this,&rsquo; he said bitterly, and tore
      it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Morris [it ran], what the dickens do you mean by it? I&rsquo;m in an awful
      hole down here; I have to go on tick, and the parties on the spot don&rsquo;t
      cotton to the idea; they couldn&rsquo;t, because it is so plain I&rsquo;m in a stait
      of Destitution. I&rsquo;ve got no bedclothes, think of that, I must have coins,
      the hole thing&rsquo;s a Mockry, I wont stand it, nobody would. I would have
      come away before, only I have no money for the railway fare. Don&rsquo;t be a
      lunatic, Morris, you don&rsquo;t seem to understand my dredful situation. I have
      to get the stamp on tick. A fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Ever your affte. Brother,
    </p>
    <p>
      J. FINSBURY
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t even spell!&rsquo; Morris reflected, as he crammed the letter in his
      pocket, and left the house. &lsquo;What can I do for him? I have to go to the
      expense of a barber, I&rsquo;m so shattered! How can I send anybody coins? It&rsquo;s
      hard lines, I daresay; but does he think I&rsquo;m living on hot muffins? One
      comfort,&rsquo; was his grim reflection, &lsquo;he can&rsquo;t cut and run&mdash;he&rsquo;s got to
      stay; he&rsquo;s as helpless as the dead.&rsquo; And then he broke forth again:
      &lsquo;Complains, does he? and he&rsquo;s never even heard of Bent Pitman! If he had
      what I have on my mind, he might complain with a good grace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But these were not honest arguments, or not wholly honest; there was a
      struggle in the mind of Morris; he could not disguise from himself that
      his brother John was miserably situated at Browndean, without news,
      without money, without bedclothes, without society or any entertainment;
      and by the time he had been shaved and picked a hasty breakfast at a
      coffee tavern, Morris had arrived at a compromise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Johnny,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s in an awful box! I can&rsquo;t send him
      coins, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do: I&rsquo;ll send him the Pink Un&mdash;it&rsquo;ll
      cheer John up; and besides, it&rsquo;ll do his credit good getting anything by
      post.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, on his way to the leather business, whither he proceeded
      (according to his thrifty habit) on foot, Morris purchased and dispatched
      a single copy of that enlivening periodical, to which (in a sudden pang of
      remorse) he added at random the Athenaeum, the Revivalist, and the Penny
      Pictorial Weekly. So there was John set up with literature, and Morris had
      laid balm upon his conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to reward him, he was received in his place of business with good
      news. Orders were pouring in; there was a run on some of the back stock,
      and the figure had gone up. Even the manager appeared elated. As for
      Morris, who had almost forgotten the meaning of good news, he longed to
      sob like a little child; he could have caught the manager (a pallid man
      with startled eyebrows) to his bosom; he could have found it in his
      generosity to give a cheque (for a small sum) to every clerk in the
      counting-house. As he sat and opened his letters a chorus of airy
      vocalists sang in his brain, to most exquisite music, &lsquo;This whole concern
      may be profitable yet, profitable yet, profitable yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To him, in this sunny moment of relief, enter a Mr Rodgerson, a creditor,
      but not one who was expected to be pressing, for his connection with the
      firm was old and regular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, Finsbury,&rsquo; said he, not without embarrassment, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s of course only
      fair to let you know&mdash;the fact is, money is a trifle tight&mdash;I
      have some paper out&mdash;for that matter, every one&rsquo;s complaining&mdash;and
      in short&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has never been our habit, Rodgerson,&rsquo; said Morris, turning pale. &lsquo;But
      give me time to turn round, and I&rsquo;ll see what I can do; I daresay we can
      let you have something to account.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just where is,&rsquo; replied Rodgerson. &lsquo;I was tempted; I&rsquo;ve let
      the credit out of MY hands.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out of your hands?&rsquo; repeated Morris. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s playing rather fast and
      loose with us, Mr Rodgerson.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I got cent. for cent. for it,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;on the nail, in a
      certified cheque.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cent. for cent.!&rsquo; cried Morris. &lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s something like thirty per
      cent. bonus; a singular thing! Who&rsquo;s the party?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know the man,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Name of Moss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Jew,&rsquo; Morris reflected, when his visitor was gone. And what could a Jew
      want with a claim of&mdash;he verified the amount in the books&mdash;a
      claim of three five eight, nineteen, ten, against the house of Finsbury?
      And why should he pay cent. for cent.? The figure proved the loyalty of
      Rodgerson&mdash;even Morris admitted that. But it proved unfortunately
      something else&mdash;the eagerness of Moss. The claim must have been
      wanted instantly, for that day, for that morning even. Why? The mystery of
      Moss promised to be a fit pendant to the mystery of Pitman. &lsquo;And just when
      all was looking well too!&rsquo; cried Morris, smiting his hand upon the desk.
      And almost at the same moment Mr Moss was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Moss was a radiant Hebrew, brutally handsome, and offensively polite.
      He was acting, it appeared, for a third party; he understood nothing of
      the circumstances; his client desired to have his position regularized;
      but he would accept an antedated cheque&mdash;antedated by two months, if
      Mr Finsbury chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand this,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;What made you pay cent. per
      cent. for it today?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Moss had no idea; only his orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The whole thing is thoroughly irregular,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;It is not the
      custom of the trade to settle at this time of the year. What are your
      instructions if I refuse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am to see Mr Joseph Finsbury, the head of the firm,&rsquo; said Mr Moss. &lsquo;I
      was directed to insist on that; it was implied you had no status here&mdash;the
      expressions are not mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot see Mr Joseph; he is unwell,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case I was to place the matter in the hands of a lawyer. Let me
      see,&rsquo; said Mr Moss, opening a pocket-book with, perhaps, suspicious care,
      at the right place&mdash;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;of Mr Michael Finsbury. A relation,
      perhaps? In that case, I presume, the matter will be pleasantly arranged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To pass into the hands of Michael was too much for Morris. He struck his
      colours. A cheque at two months was nothing, after all. In two months he
      would probably be dead, or in a gaol at any rate. He bade the manager give
      Mr Moss a chair and the paper. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going over to get a cheque signed by
      Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;who is lying ill at John Street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab there and a cab back; here were inroads on his wretched capital! He
      counted the cost; when he was done with Mr Moss he would be left with
      twelvepence-halfpenny in the world. What was even worse, he had now been
      forced to bring his uncle up to Bloomsbury. &lsquo;No use for poor Johnny in
      Hampshire now,&rsquo; he reflected. &lsquo;And how the farce is to be kept up
      completely passes me. At Browndean it was just possible; in Bloomsbury it
      seems beyond human ingenuity&mdash;though I suppose it&rsquo;s what Michael
      does. But then he has accomplices&mdash;that Scotsman and the whole gang.
      Ah, if I had accomplices!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Necessity is the mother of the arts. Under a spur so immediate, Morris
      surprised himself by the neatness and dispatch of his new forgery, and
      within three-fourths of an hour had handed it to Mr Moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is very satisfactory,&rsquo; observed that gentleman, rising. &lsquo;I was to
      tell you it will not be presented, but you had better take care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The room swam round Morris. &lsquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; he cried, grasping
      the table. He was miserably conscious the next moment of his shrill tongue
      and ashen face. &lsquo;What do you mean&mdash;it will not be presented? Why am I
      to take care? What is all this mummery?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no idea, Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; replied the smiling Hebrew. &lsquo;It was a
      message I was to deliver. The expressions were put into my mouth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your client&rsquo;s name?&rsquo; asked Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a secret for the moment,&rsquo; answered Mr Moss. Morris bent toward
      him. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not the bank?&rsquo; he asked hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no authority to say more, Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; returned Mr Moss. &lsquo;I will
      wish you a good morning, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wish me a good morning!&rsquo; thought Morris; and the next moment, seizing his
      hat, he fled from his place of business like a madman. Three streets away
      he stopped and groaned. &lsquo;Lord! I should have borrowed from the manager!&rsquo; 
      he cried. &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s too late now; it would look dicky to go back; I&rsquo;m
      penniless&mdash;simply penniless&mdash;like the unemployed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home and sat in the dismantled dining-room with his head in his
      hands. Newton never thought harder than this victim of circumstances, and
      yet no clearness came. &lsquo;It may be a defect in my intelligence,&rsquo; he cried,
      rising to his feet, &lsquo;but I cannot see that I am fairly used. The bad luck
      I&rsquo;ve had is a thing to write to The Times about; it&rsquo;s enough to breed a
      revolution. And the plain English of the whole thing is that I must have
      money at once. I&rsquo;m done with all morality now; I&rsquo;m long past that stage;
      money I must have, and the only chance I see is Bent Pitman. Bent Pitman
      is a criminal, and therefore his position&rsquo;s weak. He must have some of
      that eight hundred left; if he has I&rsquo;ll force him to go shares; and even
      if he hasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll tell him the tontine affair, and with a desperate man
      like Pitman at my back, it&rsquo;ll be strange if I don&rsquo;t succeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well and good. But how to lay hands upon Bent Pitman, except by
      advertisement, was not so clear. And even so, in what terms to ask a
      meeting? on what grounds? and where? Not at John Street, for it would
      never do to let a man like Bent Pitman know your real address; nor yet at
      Pitman&rsquo;s house, some dreadful place in Holloway, with a trapdoor in the
      back kitchen; a house which you might enter in a light summer overcoat and
      varnished boots, to come forth again piecemeal in a market-basket. That
      was the drawback of a really efficient accomplice, Morris felt, not
      without a shudder. &lsquo;I never dreamed I should come to actually covet such
      society,&rsquo; he thought. And then a brilliant idea struck him. Waterloo
      Station, a public place, yet at certain hours of the day a solitary; a
      place, besides, the very name of which must knock upon the heart of
      Pitman, and at once suggest a knowledge of the latest of his guilty
      secrets. Morris took a piece of paper and sketched his advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILLIAM BENT PITMAN, if this should meet the eye of, he will hear of
      SOMETHING TO HIS ADVANTAGE on the far end of the main line departure
      platform, Waterloo Station, 2 to 4 P.M., Sunday next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris reperused this literary trifle with approbation. &lsquo;Terse,&rsquo; he
      reflected. &lsquo;Something to his advantage is not strictly true; but it&rsquo;s
      taking and original, and a man is not on oath in an advertisement. All
      that I require now is the ready cash for my own meals and for the
      advertisement, and&mdash;no, I can&rsquo;t lavish money upon John, but I&rsquo;ll give
      him some more papers. How to raise the wind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached his cabinet of signets, and the collector suddenly revolted
      in his blood. &lsquo;I will not!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;nothing shall induce me to massacre
      my collection&mdash;rather theft!&rsquo; And dashing upstairs to the
      drawing-room, he helped himself to a few of his uncle&rsquo;s curiosities: a
      pair of Turkish babooshes, a Smyrna fan, a water-cooler, a musket
      guaranteed to have been seized from an Ephesian bandit, and a pocketful of
      curious but incomplete seashells.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. William Bent Pitman Hears of Something to his Advantage
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the morning of Sunday, William Dent Pitman rose at his usual hour,
      although with something more than the usual reluctance. The day before (it
      should be explained) an addition had been made to his family in the person
      of a lodger. Michael Finsbury had acted sponsor in the business, and
      guaranteed the weekly bill; on the other hand, no doubt with a spice of
      his prevailing jocularity, he had drawn a depressing portrait of the
      lodger&rsquo;s character. Mr Pitman had been led to understand his guest was not
      good company; he had approached the gentleman with fear, and had rejoiced
      to find himself the entertainer of an angel. At tea he had been vastly
      pleased; till hard on one in the morning he had sat entranced by eloquence
      and progressively fortified with information in the studio; and now, as he
      reviewed over his toilet the harmless pleasures of the evening, the future
      smiled upon him with revived attractions. &lsquo;Mr Finsbury is indeed an
      acquisition,&rsquo; he remarked to himself; and as he entered the little
      parlour, where the table was already laid for breakfast, the cordiality of
      his greeting would have befitted an acquaintanceship already old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am delighted to see you, sir&rsquo;&mdash;these were his expressions&mdash;&lsquo;and
      I trust you have slept well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Accustomed as I have been for so long to a life of almost perpetual
      change,&rsquo; replied the guest, &lsquo;the disturbance so often complained of by the
      more sedentary, as attending their first night in (what is called) a new
      bed, is a complaint from which I am entirely free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am delighted to hear it,&rsquo; said the drawing-master warmly. &lsquo;But I see I
      have interrupted you over the paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Sunday paper is one of the features of the age,&rsquo; said Mr Finsbury.
      &lsquo;In America, I am told, it supersedes all other literature, the bone and
      sinew of the nation finding their requirements catered for; hundreds of
      columns will be occupied with interesting details of the world&rsquo;s doings,
      such as water-spouts, elopements, conflagrations, and public
      entertainments; there is a corner for politics, ladies&rsquo; work, chess,
      religion, and even literature; and a few spicy editorials serve to direct
      the course of public thought. It is difficult to estimate the part played
      by such enormous and miscellaneous repositories in the education of the
      people. But this (though interesting in itself) partakes of the nature of
      a digression; and what I was about to ask you was this: Are you yourself a
      student of the daily press?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is not much in the papers to interest an artist,&rsquo; returned Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; resumed Joseph, &lsquo;an advertisement which has appeared the
      last two days in various journals, and reappears this morning, may
      possibly have failed to catch your eye. The name, with a trifling
      variation, bears a strong resemblance to your own. Ah, here it is. If you
      please, I will read it to you:
    </p>
    <p>
      WILIAM BENT PITMAN, if this should meet the eye of, he will hear of
      SOMETHING TO HIS ADVANTAGE at the far end of the main line departure
      platform, Waterloo Station, 2 to 4 P.M. today.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that in print?&rsquo; cried Pitman. &lsquo;Let me see it! Bent? It must be Dent!
      SOMETHING TO MY ADVANTAGE? Mr Finsbury, excuse me offering a word of
      caution; I am aware how strangely this must sound in your ears, but there
      are domestic reasons why this little circumstance might perhaps be better
      kept between ourselves. Mrs Pitman&mdash;my dear Sir, I assure you there
      is nothing dishonourable in my secrecy; the reasons are domestic, merely
      domestic; and I may set your conscience at rest when I assure you all the
      circumstances are known to our common friend, your excellent nephew, Mr
      Michael, who has not withdrawn from me his esteem.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A word is enough, Mr Pitman,&rsquo; said Joseph, with one of his Oriental
      reverences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, the drawing-master found Michael in bed and reading a
      book, the picture of good-humour and repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hillo, Pitman,&rsquo; he said, laying down his book, &lsquo;what brings you here at
      this inclement hour? Ought to be in church, my boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have little thought of church today, Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; said the
      drawing-master. &lsquo;I am on the brink of something new, Sir.&rsquo; And he
      presented the advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what is this?&rsquo; cried Michael, sitting suddenly up. He studied it for
      half a minute with a frown. &lsquo;Pitman, I don&rsquo;t care about this document a
      particle,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will have to be attended to, however,&rsquo; said Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought you&rsquo;d had enough of Waterloo,&rsquo; returned the lawyer. &lsquo;Have you
      started a morbid craving? You&rsquo;ve never been yourself anyway since you lost
      that beard. I believe now it was where you kept your senses.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; said the drawing-master, &lsquo;I have tried to reason this
      matter out, and, with your permission, I should like to lay before you the
      results.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fire away,&rsquo; said Michael; &lsquo;but please, Pitman, remember it&rsquo;s Sunday, and
      let&rsquo;s have no bad language.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are three views open to us,&rsquo; began Pitman. &lsquo;First this may be
      connected with the barrel; second, it may be connected with Mr
      Semitopolis&rsquo;s statue; and third, it may be from my wife&rsquo;s brother, who
      went to Australia. In the first case, which is of course possible, I
      confess the matter would be best allowed to drop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The court is with you there, Brother Pitman,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the second,&rsquo; continued the other, &lsquo;it is plainly my duty to leave no
      stone unturned for the recovery of the lost antique.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear fellow, Semitopolis has come down like a trump; he has pocketed
      the loss and left you the profit. What more would you have?&rsquo; enquired the
      lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I conceive, sir, under correction, that Mr Semitopolis&rsquo;s generosity binds
      me to even greater exertion,&rsquo; said the drawing-master. &lsquo;The whole business
      was unfortunate; it was&mdash;I need not disguise it from you&mdash;it was
      illegal from the first: the more reason that I should try to behave like a
      gentleman,&rsquo; concluded Pitman, flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have nothing to say to that,&rsquo; returned the lawyer. &lsquo;I have sometimes
      thought I should like to try to behave like a gentleman myself; only it&rsquo;s
      such a one-sided business, with the world and the legal profession as they
      are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, in the third,&rsquo; resumed the drawing-master, &lsquo;if it&rsquo;s Uncle Tim, of
      course, our fortune&rsquo;s made.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not Uncle Tim, though,&rsquo; said the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you observed that very remarkable expression: SOMETHING TO HIS
      ADVANTAGE?&rsquo; enquired Pitman shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You innocent mutton,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the seediest commonplace in the
      English language, and only proves the advertiser is an ass. Let me
      demolish your house of cards for you at once. Would Uncle Tim make that
      blunder in your name?&mdash;in itself, the blunder is delicious, a huge
      improvement on the gross reality, and I mean to adopt it in the future;
      but is it like Uncle Tim?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s not like him,&rsquo; Pitman admitted. &lsquo;But his mind may have become
      unhinged at Ballarat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you come to that, Pitman,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;the advertiser may be Queen
      Victoria, fired with the desire to make a duke of you. I put it to
      yourself if that&rsquo;s probable; and yet it&rsquo;s not against the laws of nature.
      But we sit here to consider probabilities; and with your genteel
      permission, I eliminate her Majesty and Uncle Tim on the threshold. To
      proceed, we have your second idea, that this has some connection with the
      statue. Possible; but in that case who is the advertiser? Not Ricardi, for
      he knows your address; not the person who got the box, for he doesn&rsquo;t know
      your name. The vanman, I hear you suggest, in a lucid interval. He might
      have got your name, and got it incorrectly, at the station; and he might
      have failed to get your address. I grant the vanman. But a question: Do
      you really wish to meet the vanman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should I not?&rsquo; asked Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he wants to meet you,&rsquo; replied Michael, &lsquo;observe this: it is because
      he has found his address-book, has been to the house that got the statue,
      and-mark my words!&mdash;is moving at the instigation of the murderer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be very sorry to think so,&rsquo; said Pitman; &lsquo;but I still consider
      it my duty to Mr Sernitopolis. . .&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pitman,&rsquo; interrupted Michael, &lsquo;this will not do. Don&rsquo;t seek to impose on
      your legal adviser; don&rsquo;t try to pass yourself off for the Duke of
      Wellington, for that is not your line. Come, I wager a dinner I can read
      your thoughts. You still believe it&rsquo;s Uncle Tim.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; said the drawing-master, colouring, &lsquo;you are not a man in
      narrow circumstances, and you have no family. Guendolen is growing up, a
      very promising girl&mdash;she was confirmed this year; and I think you
      will be able to enter into my feelings as a parent when I tell you she is
      quite ignorant of dancing. The boys are at the board school, which is all
      very well in its way; at least, I am the last man in the world to
      criticize the institutions of my native land. But I had fondly hoped that
      Harold might become a professional musician; and little Otho shows a quite
      remarkable vocation for the Church. I am not exactly an ambitious man...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; interrupted Michael. &lsquo;Be explicit; you think it&rsquo;s Uncle
      Tim?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It might be Uncle Tim,&rsquo; insisted Pitman, &lsquo;and if it were, and I neglected
      the occasion, how could I ever look my children in the face? I do not
      refer to Mrs Pitman. . .&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you never do,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;. . . but in the case of her own brother returning from Ballarat. . .&rsquo; 
      continued Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;. . . with his mind unhinged,&rsquo; put in the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;. . . returning from Ballarat with a large fortune, her impatience may be
      more easily imagined than described,&rsquo; concluded Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;be it so. And what do you propose to do?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to Waterloo,&rsquo; said Pitman, &lsquo;in disguise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All by your little self?&rsquo; enquired the lawyer. &lsquo;Well, I hope you think it
      safe. Mind and send me word from the police cells.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, Mr Finsbury, I had ventured to hope&mdash;perhaps you might be induced
      to&mdash;to make one of us,&rsquo; faltered Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disguise myself on Sunday?&rsquo; cried Michael. &lsquo;How little you understand my
      principles!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr Finsbury, I have no means of showing you my gratitude; but let me ask
      you one question,&rsquo; said Pitman. &lsquo;If I were a very rich client, would you
      not take the risk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Diamond, Diamond, you know not what you do!&rsquo; cried Michael. &lsquo;Why, man, do
      you suppose I make a practice of cutting about London with my clients in
      disguise? Do you suppose money would induce me to touch this business with
      a stick? I give you my word of honour, it would not. But I own I have a
      real curiosity to see how you conduct this interview&mdash;that tempts me;
      it tempts me, Pitman, more than gold&mdash;it should be exquisitely rich.&rsquo; 
      And suddenly Michael laughed. &lsquo;Well, Pitman,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;have all the truck
      ready in the studio. I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      About twenty minutes after two, on this eventful day, the vast and gloomy
      shed of Waterloo lay, like the temple of a dead religion, silent and
      deserted. Here and there at one of the platforms, a train lay becalmed;
      here and there a wandering footfall echoed; the cab-horses outside stamped
      with startling reverberations on the stones; or from the neighbouring
      wilderness of railway an engine snorted forth a whistle. The main-line
      departure platform slumbered like the rest; the booking-hutches closed;
      the backs of Mr Haggard&rsquo;s novels, with which upon a weekday the bookstall
      shines emblazoned, discreetly hidden behind dingy shutters; the rare
      officials, undisguisedly somnambulant; and the customary loiterers, even
      to the middle-aged woman with the ulster and the handbag, fled to more
      congenial scenes. As in the inmost dells of some small tropic island the
      throbbing of the ocean lingers, so here a faint pervading hum and
      trepidation told in every corner of surrounding London.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the hour already named, persons acquainted with John Dickson, of
      Ballarat, and Ezra Thomas, of the United States of America, would have
      been cheered to behold them enter through the booking-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What names are we to take?&rsquo; enquired the latter, anxiously adjusting the
      window-glass spectacles which he had been suffered on this occasion to
      assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no choice for you, my boy,&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;Bent Pitman or
      nothing. As for me, I think I look as if I might be called Appleby;
      something agreeably old-world about Appleby&mdash;breathes of Devonshire
      cider. Talking of which, suppose you wet your whistle? the interview is
      likely to be trying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait till afterwards,&rsquo; returned Pitman; &lsquo;on the whole, I
      think I&rsquo;ll wait till the thing&rsquo;s over. I don&rsquo;t know if it strikes you as
      it does me; but the place seems deserted and silent, Mr Finsbury, and
      filled with very singular echoes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kind of Jack-in-the-box feeling?&rsquo; enquired Michael, &lsquo;as if all these
      empty trains might be filled with policemen waiting for a signal? and Sir
      Charles Warren perched among the girders with a silver whistle to his
      lips? It&rsquo;s guilt, Pitman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this uneasy frame of mind they walked nearly the whole length of the
      departure platform, and at the western extremity became aware of a slender
      figure standing back against a pillar. The figure was plainly sunk into a
      deep abstraction; he was not aware of their approach, but gazed far abroad
      over the sunlit station. Michael stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Holloa!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;can that be your advertiser? If so, I&rsquo;m done with it.&rsquo; 
      And then, on second thoughts: &lsquo;Not so, either,&rsquo; he resumed more
      cheerfully. &lsquo;Here, turn your back a moment. So. Give me the specs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you agreed I was to have them,&rsquo; protested Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but that man knows me,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does he? what&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo; cried Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, he took me into his confidence,&rsquo; returned the lawyer. &lsquo;But I may say
      one thing: if he&rsquo;s your advertiser (and he may be, for he seems to have
      been seized with criminal lunacy) you can go ahead with a clear
      conscience, for I hold him in the hollow of my hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The change effected, and Pitman comforted with this good news, the pair
      drew near to Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you looking for Mr William Bent Pitman?&rsquo; enquired the drawing-master.
      &lsquo;I am he.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris raised his head. He saw before him, in the speaker, a person of
      almost indescribable insignificance, in white spats and a shirt cut
      indecently low. A little behind, a second and more burly figure offered
      little to criticism, except ulster, whiskers, spectacles, and deerstalker
      hat. Since he had decided to call up devils from the underworld of London,
      Morris had pondered deeply on the probabilities of their appearance. His
      first emotion, like that of Charoba when she beheld the sea, was one of
      disappointment; his second did more justice to the case. Never before had
      he seen a couple dressed like these; he had struck a new stratum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must speak with you alone,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You need not mind Mr Appleby,&rsquo; returned Pitman. &lsquo;He knows all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All? Do you know what I am here to speak of?&rsquo; enquired Morris&mdash;.
      &lsquo;The barrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pitman turned pale, but it was with manly indignation. &lsquo;You are the man!&rsquo; 
      he cried. &lsquo;You very wicked person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I to speak before him?&rsquo; asked Morris, disregarding these severe
      expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has been present throughout,&rsquo; said Pitman. &lsquo;He opened the barrel; your
      guilty secret is already known to him, as well as to your Maker and
      myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said Morris, &lsquo;what have you done with the money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing about any money,&rsquo; said Pitman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t try that on,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;I have tracked you down; you came
      to the station sacrilegiously disguised as a clergyman, procured my
      barrel, opened it, rifled the body, and cashed the bill. I have been to
      the bank, I tell you! I have followed you step by step, and your denials
      are childish and absurd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, Morris, keep your temper,&rsquo; said Mr Appleby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Michael!&rsquo; cried Morris, &lsquo;Michael here too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here too,&rsquo; echoed the lawyer; &lsquo;here and everywhere, my good fellow; every
      step you take is counted; trained detectives follow you like your shadow;
      they report to me every three-quarters of an hour; no expense is spared.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris&rsquo;s face took on a hue of dirty grey. &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care; I have the
      less reserve to keep,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;That man cashed my bill; it&rsquo;s a theft,
      and I want the money back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think I would lie to you, Morris?&rsquo; asked Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said his cousin. &lsquo;I want my money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was I alone who touched the body,&rsquo; began Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You? Michael!&rsquo; cried Morris, starting back. &lsquo;Then why haven&rsquo;t you
      declared the death?&rsquo; &lsquo;What the devil do you mean?&rsquo; asked Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I mad? or are you?&rsquo; cried Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think it must be Pitman,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three men stared at each other, wild-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is dreadful,&rsquo; said Morris, &lsquo;dreadful. I do not understand one word
      that is addressed to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I give you my word of honour, no more do I,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And in God&rsquo;s name, why whiskers?&rsquo; cried Morris, pointing in a ghastly
      manner at his cousin. &lsquo;Does my brain reel? How whiskers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, that&rsquo;s a matter of detail,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence, during which Morris appeared to himself to be
      shot in a trapeze as high as St Paul&rsquo;s, and as low as Baker Street
      Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us recapitulate,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;unless it&rsquo;s really a dream, in which
      case I wish Teena would call me for breakfast. My friend Pitman, here,
      received a barrel which, it now appears, was meant for you. The barrel
      contained the body of a man. How or why you killed him...&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never laid a hand on him,&rsquo; protested Morris. &lsquo;This is what I have
      dreaded all along. But think, Michael! I&rsquo;m not that kind of man; with all
      my faults, I wouldn&rsquo;t touch a hair of anybody&rsquo;s head, and it was all dead
      loss to me. He got killed in that vile accident.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Michael was seized by mirth so prolonged and excessive that his
      companions supposed beyond a doubt his reason had deserted him. Again and
      again he struggled to compose himself, and again and again laughter
      overwhelmed him like a tide. In all this maddening interview there had
      been no more spectral feature than this of Michael&rsquo;s merriment; and Pitman
      and Morris, drawn together by the common fear, exchanged glances of
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morris,&rsquo; gasped the lawyer, when he was at last able to articulate, &lsquo;hold
      on, I see it all now. I can make it clear in one word. Here&rsquo;s the key: I
      NEVER GUESSED IT WAS UNCLE JOSEPH TILL THIS MOMENT.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark produced an instant lightening of the tension for Morris. For
      Pitman it quenched the last ray of hope and daylight. Uncle Joseph, whom
      he had left an hour ago in Norfolk Street, pasting newspaper cuttings?&mdash;it?&mdash;the
      dead body?&mdash;then who was he, Pitman? and was this Waterloo Station or
      Colney Hatch?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; cried Morris; &lsquo;it was badly smashed, I know. How stupid not
      to think of that! Why, then, all&rsquo;s clear; and, my dear Michael, I&rsquo;ll tell
      you what&mdash;we&rsquo;re saved, both saved. You get the tontine&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      grudge it you the least&mdash;and I get the leather business, which is
      really beginning to look up. Declare the death at once, don&rsquo;t mind me in
      the smallest, don&rsquo;t consider me; declare the death, and we&rsquo;re all right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, but I can&rsquo;t declare it,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; cried Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t produce the corpus, Morris. I&rsquo;ve lost it,&rsquo; said the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a bit,&rsquo; ejaculated the leather merchant. &lsquo;How is this? It&rsquo;s not
      possible. I lost it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve lost it too, my son,&rsquo; said Michael, with extreme serenity.
      &lsquo;Not recognizing it, you see, and suspecting something irregular in its
      origin, I got rid of&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;got rid of the
      proceeds at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You got rid of the body? What made you do that?&rsquo; walled Morris. &lsquo;But you
      can get it again? You know where it is?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish I did, Morris, and you may believe me there, for it would be a
      small sum in my pocket; but the fact is, I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good Lord,&rsquo; said Morris, addressing heaven and earth, &lsquo;good Lord, I&rsquo;ve
      lost the leather business!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael was once more shaken with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you laugh, you fool?&rsquo; cried his cousin, &lsquo;you lose more than I.
      You&rsquo;ve bungled it worse than even I did. If you had a spark of feeling,
      you would be shaking in your boots with vexation. But I&rsquo;ll tell you one
      thing&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have that eight hundred pound&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have that and go
      to Swan River&mdash;that&rsquo;s mine, anyway, and your friend must have forged
      to cash it. Give me the eight hundred, here, upon this platform, or I go
      straight to Scotland Yard and turn the whole disreputable story inside
      out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morris,&rsquo; said Michael, laying his hand upon his shoulder, &lsquo;hear reason.
      It wasn&rsquo;t us, it was the other man. We never even searched the body.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The other man?&rsquo; repeated Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the other man. We palmed Uncle Joseph off upon another man,&rsquo; said
      Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You what? You palmed him off? That&rsquo;s surely a singular expression,&rsquo; said
      Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, palmed him off for a piano,&rsquo; said Michael with perfect simplicity.
      &lsquo;Remarkably full, rich tone,&rsquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris carried his hand to his brow and looked at it; it was wet with
      sweat. &lsquo;Fever,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it was a Broadwood grand,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;Pitman here will tell you
      if it was genuine or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eh? O! O yes, I believe it was a genuine Broadwood; I have played upon it
      several times myself,&rsquo; said Pitman. &lsquo;The three-letter E was broken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything more about pianos,&rsquo; said Morris, with a strong
      shudder; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not the man I used to be! This&mdash;this other man&mdash;let&rsquo;s
      come to him, if I can only manage to follow. Who is he? Where can I get
      hold of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the rub,&rsquo; said Michael. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been in possession of the
      desired article, let me see&mdash;since Wednesday, about four o&rsquo;clock, and
      is now, I should imagine, on his way to the isles of Javan and Gadire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Michael,&rsquo; said Morris pleadingly, &lsquo;I am in a very weak state, and I beg
      your consideration for a kinsman. Say it slowly again, and be sure you are
      correct. When did he get it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael repeated his statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the worst thing yet,&rsquo; said Morris, drawing in his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is?&rsquo; asked the lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Even the dates are sheer nonsense,&rsquo; said the leather merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The bill was cashed on Tuesday. There&rsquo;s not a gleam of reason in the
      whole transaction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A young gentleman, who had passed the trio and suddenly started and turned
      back, at this moment laid a heavy hand on Michael&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha! so this is Mr Dickson?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trump of judgement could scarce have rung with a more dreadful note in
      the ears of Pitman and the lawyer. To Morris this erroneous name seemed a
      legitimate enough continuation of the nightmare in which he had so long
      been wandering. And when Michael, with his brand-new bushy whiskers, broke
      from the grasp of the stranger and turned to run, and the weird little
      shaven creature in the low-necked shirt followed his example with a
      bird-like screech, and the stranger (finding the rest of his prey escape
      him) pounced with a rude grasp on Morris himself, that gentleman&rsquo;s frame
      of mind might be very nearly expressed in the colloquial phrase: &lsquo;I told
      you so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have one of the gang,&rsquo; said Gideon Forsyth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not understand,&rsquo; said Morris dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I will make you understand,&rsquo; returned Gideon grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be a good friend to me if you can make me understand anything,&rsquo; 
      cried Morris, with a sudden energy of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know you personally, do I?&rsquo; continued Gideon, examining his
      unresisting prisoner. &lsquo;Never mind, I know your friends. They are your
      friends, are they not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not understand you,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had possibly something to do with a piano?&rsquo; suggested Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A piano!&rsquo; cried Morris, convulsively clasping Gideon by the arm. &lsquo;Then
      you&rsquo;re the other man! Where is it? Where is the body? And did you cash the
      draft?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is the body? This is very strange,&rsquo; mused Gideon. &lsquo;Do you want the
      body?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Want it?&rsquo; cried Morris. &lsquo;My whole fortune depends upon it! I lost it.
      Where is it? Take me to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, you want it, do you? And the other man, Dickson&mdash;does he want
      it?&rsquo; enquired Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who do you mean by Dickson? O, Michael Finsbury! Why, of course he does!
      He lost it too. If he had it, he&rsquo;d have won the tontine tomorrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Michael Finsbury! Not the solicitor?&rsquo; cried Gideon. &lsquo;Yes, the solicitor,&rsquo; 
      said Morris. &lsquo;But where is the body?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then that is why he sent the brief! What is Mr Finsbury&rsquo;s private
      address?&rsquo; asked Gideon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;233 King&rsquo;s Road. What brief? Where are you going? Where is the body?&rsquo; 
      cried Morris, clinging to Gideon&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have lost it myself,&rsquo; returned Gideon, and ran out of the station.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. The Return of the Great Vance
    </h2>
    <p>
      Morris returned from Waterloo in a frame of mind that baffles description.
      He was a modest man; he had never conceived an overweening notion of his
      own powers; he knew himself unfit to write a book, turn a table
      napkin-ring, entertain a Christmas party with legerdemain&mdash;grapple
      (in short) any of those conspicuous accomplishments that are usually
      classed under the head of genius. He knew&mdash;he admitted&mdash;his
      parts to be pedestrian, but he had considered them (until quite lately)
      fully equal to the demands of life. And today he owned himself defeated:
      life had the upper hand; if there had been any means of flight or place to
      flee to, if the world had been so ordered that a man could leave it like a
      place of entertainment, Morris would have instantly resigned all further
      claim on its rewards and pleasures, and, with inexpressible contentment,
      ceased to be. As it was, one aim shone before him: he could get home. Even
      as the sick dog crawls under the sofa, Morris could shut the door of John
      Street and be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dusk was falling when he drew near this place of refuge; and the first
      thing that met his eyes was the figure of a man upon the step, alternately
      plucking at the bell-handle and pounding on the panels. The man had no
      hat, his clothes were hideous with filth, he had the air of a hop-picker.
      Yet Morris knew him; it was John.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first impulse of flight was succeeded, in the elder brother&rsquo;s bosom,
      by the empty quiescence of despair. &lsquo;What does it matter now?&rsquo; he thought,
      and drawing forth his latchkey ascended the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      John turned about; his face was ghastly with weariness and dirt and fury;
      and as he recognized the head of his family, he drew in a long rasping
      breath, and his eyes glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open that door,&rsquo; he said, standing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to,&rsquo; said Morris, and added mentally, &lsquo;He looks like murder!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brothers passed into the hall, the door closed behind them; and
      suddenly John seized Morris by the shoulders and shook him as a terrier
      shakes a rat. &lsquo;You mangy little cad,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d serve you right to
      smash your skull!&rsquo; And shook him again, so that his teeth rattled and his
      head smote upon the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be violent, Johnny,&rsquo; said Morris. &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t do any good now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shut your mouth,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;your time&rsquo;s come to listen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode into the dining-room, fell into the easy-chair, and taking off
      one of his burst walking-shoes, nursed for a while his foot like one in
      agony. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m lame for life,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;What is there for dinner?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, Johnny,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing? What do you mean by that?&rsquo; enquired the Great Vance. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t set
      up your chat to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean simply nothing,&rsquo; said his brother. &lsquo;I have nothing to eat, and
      nothing to buy it with. I&rsquo;ve only had a cup of tea and a sandwich all this
      day myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only a sandwich?&rsquo; sneered Vance. &lsquo;I suppose YOU&rsquo;RE going to complain
      next. But you had better take care: I&rsquo;ve had all I mean to take; and I can
      tell you what it is, I mean to dine and to dine well. Take your signets
      and sell them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t today,&rsquo; objected Morris; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Sunday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m going to dine!&rsquo; cried the younger brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if it&rsquo;s not possible, Johnny?&rsquo; pleaded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You nincompoop!&rsquo; cried Vance. &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t we householders? Don&rsquo;t they know us
      at that hotel where Uncle Parker used to come. Be off with you; and if you
      ain&rsquo;t back in half an hour, and if the dinner ain&rsquo;t good, first I&rsquo;ll lick
      you till you don&rsquo;t want to breathe, and then I&rsquo;ll go straight to the
      police and blow the gaff. Do you understand that, Morris Finsbury? Because
      if you do, you had better jump.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea smiled even upon the wretched Morris, who was sick with famine.
      He sped upon his errand, and returned to find John still nursing his foot
      in the armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would you like to drink, Johnny?&rsquo; he enquired soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fizz,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;Some of the poppy stuff from the end bin; a bottle of
      the old port that Michael liked, to follow; and see and don&rsquo;t shake the
      port. And look here, light the fire&mdash;and the gas, and draw down the
      blinds; it&rsquo;s cold and it&rsquo;s getting dark. And then you can lay the cloth.
      And, I say&mdash;here, you! bring me down some clothes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The room looked comparatively habitable by the time the dinner came; and
      the dinner itself was good: strong gravy soup, fillets of sole, mutton
      chops and tomato sauce, roast beef done rare with roast potatoes, cabinet
      pudding, a piece of Chester cheese, and some early celery: a meal
      uncompromisingly British, but supporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; said John, his nostrils sniffing wide, surprised by joy into
      the unwonted formality of grace. &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to take this chair with my
      back to the fire&mdash;there&rsquo;s been a strong frost these two last nights,
      and I can&rsquo;t get it out of my bones; the celery will be just the ticket&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      going to sit here, and you are going to stand there, Morris Finsbury, and
      play butler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Johnny, I&rsquo;m so hungry myself,&rsquo; pleaded Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can have what I leave,&rsquo; said Vance. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re just beginning to pay
      your score, my daisy; I owe you one-pound-ten; don&rsquo;t you rouse the British
      lion!&rsquo; There was something indescribably menacing in the face and voice of
      the Great Vance as he uttered these words, at which the soul of Morris
      withered. &lsquo;There!&rsquo; resumed the feaster, &lsquo;give us a glass of the fizz to
      start with. Gravy soup! And I thought I didn&rsquo;t like gravy soup! Do you
      know how I got here?&rsquo; he asked, with another explosion of wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, Johnny; how could I?&rsquo; said the obsequious Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I walked on my ten toes!&rsquo; cried John; &lsquo;tramped the whole way from
      Browndean; and begged! I would like to see you beg. It&rsquo;s not so easy as
      you might suppose. I played it on being a shipwrecked mariner from Blyth;
      I don&rsquo;t know where Blyth is, do you? but I thought it sounded natural. I
      begged from a little beast of a schoolboy, and he forked out a bit of
      twine, and asked me to make a clove hitch; I did, too, I know I did, but
      he said it wasn&rsquo;t, he said it was a granny&rsquo;s knot, and I was a
      what-d&rsquo;ye-call-&rsquo;em, and he would give me in charge. Then I begged from a
      naval officer&mdash;he never bothered me with knots, but he only gave me a
      tract; there&rsquo;s a nice account of the British navy!&mdash;and then from a
      widow woman that sold lollipops, and I got a hunch of bread from her.
      Another party I fell in with said you could generally always get bread;
      and the thing to do was to break a plateglass window and get into gaol;
      seemed rather a brilliant scheme. Pass the beef.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stay at Browndean?&rsquo; Morris ventured to enquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Skittles!&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;On what? The Pink Un and a measly religious paper?
      I had to leave Browndean; I had to, I tell you. I got tick at a public,
      and set up to be the Great Vance; so would you, if you were leading such a
      beastly existence! And a card stood me a lot of ale and stuff, and we got
      swipey, talking about music-halls and the piles of tin I got for singing;
      and then they got me on to sing &ldquo;Around her splendid form I weaved the
      magic circle,&rdquo; and then he said I couldn&rsquo;t be Vance, and I stuck to it
      like grim death I was. It was rot of me to sing, of course, but I thought
      I could brazen it out with a set of yokels. It settled my hash at the
      public,&rsquo; said John, with a sigh. &lsquo;And then the last thing was the
      carpenter&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our landlord?&rsquo; enquired Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the party,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;He came nosing about the place, and then
      wanted to know where the water-butt was, and the bedclothes. I told him to
      go to the devil; so would you too, when there was no possible thing to
      say! And then he said I had pawned them, and did I know it was felony?
      Then I made a pretty neat stroke. I remembered he was deaf, and talked a
      whole lot of rot, very politely, just so low he couldn&rsquo;t hear a word. &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t hear you,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, my buck, and I don&rsquo;t mean you
      to,&rdquo; says I, smiling away like a haberdasher. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hard of hearing,&rdquo; he
      roars. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be in a pretty hot corner if you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says I, making
      signs as if I was explaining everything. It was tip-top as long as it
      lasted. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m deaf, worse luck, but I bet the constable
      can hear you.&rdquo; And off he started one way, and I the other. They got a
      spirit-lamp and the Pink Un, and that old religious paper, and another
      periodical you sent me. I think you must have been drunk&mdash;it had a
      name like one of those spots that Uncle Joseph used to hold forth at, and
      it was all full of the most awful swipes about poetry and the use of the
      globes. It was the kind of thing that nobody could read out of a lunatic
      asylum. The Athaeneum, that was the name! Golly, what a paper!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Athenaeum, you mean,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you call it,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;so as I don&rsquo;t require to take
      it in! There, I feel better. Now I&rsquo;m going to sit by the fire in the
      easy-chair; pass me the cheese, and the celery, and the bottle of port&mdash;no,
      a champagne glass, it holds more. And now you can pitch in; there&rsquo;s some
      of the fish left and a chop, and some fizz. Ah,&rsquo; sighed the refreshed
      pedestrian, &lsquo;Michael was right about that port; there&rsquo;s old and vatted for
      you! Michael&rsquo;s a man I like; he&rsquo;s clever and reads books, and the
      Athaeneum, and all that; but he&rsquo;s not dreary to meet, he don&rsquo;t talk
      Athaeneum like the other parties; why, the most of them would throw a
      blight over a skittle alley! Talking of Michael, I ain&rsquo;t bored myself to
      put the question, because of course I knew it from the first. You&rsquo;ve made
      a hash of it, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Michael made a hash of it,&rsquo; said Morris, flushing dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have we got to do with that?&rsquo; enquired John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has lost the body, that&rsquo;s what we have to do with it,&rsquo; cried Morris.
      &lsquo;He has lost the body, and the death can&rsquo;t be established.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold on,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t want to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, we&rsquo;re far past that,&rsquo; said his brother. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not the tontine now,
      it&rsquo;s the leather business, Johnny; it&rsquo;s the clothes upon our back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stow the slow music,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;and tell your story from beginning to
      end.&rsquo; Morris did as he was bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, now, what did I tell you?&rsquo; cried the Great Vance, when the other
      had done. &lsquo;But I know one thing: I&rsquo;m not going to be humbugged out of my
      property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to know what you mean to do,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that,&rsquo; responded John with extreme decision. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to
      put my interests in the hands of the smartest lawyer in London; and
      whether you go to quod or not is a matter of indifference to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Johnny, we&rsquo;re in the same boat!&rsquo; expostulated Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are we?&rsquo; cried his brother. &lsquo;I bet we&rsquo;re not! Have I committed forgery?
      have I lied about Uncle Joseph? have I put idiotic advertisements in the
      comic papers? have I smashed other people&rsquo;s statues? I like your cheek,
      Morris Finsbury. No, I&rsquo;ve let you run my affairs too long; now they shall
      go to Michael. I like Michael, anyway; and it&rsquo;s time I understood my
      situation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the brethren were interrupted by a ring at the bell, and
      Morris, going timorously to the door, received from the hands of a
      commissionaire a letter addressed in the hand of Michael. Its contents ran
      as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      MORRIS FINSBURY, if this should meet the eye of, he will hear of SOMETHING
      TO HIS ADVANTAGE at my office, in Chancery Lane, at 10 A.M. tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MICHAEL FINSBURY
    </p>
    <p>
      So utter was Morris&rsquo;s subjection that he did not wait to be asked, but
      handed the note to John as soon as he had glanced at it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way to write a letter,&rsquo; cried John. &lsquo;Nobody but Michael could
      have written that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And Morris did not even claim the credit of priority.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. Final Adjustment of the Leather Business
    </h2>
    <p>
      Finsbury brothers were ushered, at ten the next morning, into a large
      apartment in Michael&rsquo;s office; the Great Vance, somewhat restored from
      yesterday&rsquo;s exhaustion, but with one foot in a slipper; Morris, not
      positively damaged, but a man ten years older than he who had left
      Bournemouth eight days before, his face ploughed full of anxious wrinkles,
      his dark hair liberally grizzled at the temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three persons were seated at a table to receive them: Michael in the
      midst, Gideon Forsyth on his right hand, on his left an ancient gentleman
      with spectacles and silver hair. &lsquo;By Jingo, it&rsquo;s Uncle Joe!&rsquo; cried John.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Morris approached his uncle with a pale countenance and glittering
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you did!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;You absconded!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good morning, Morris Finsbury,&rsquo; returned Joseph, with no less asperity;
      &lsquo;you are looking seriously ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No use making trouble now,&rsquo; remarked Michael. &lsquo;Look the facts in the
      face. Your uncle, as you see, was not so much as shaken in the accident; a
      man of your humane disposition ought to be delighted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, if that&rsquo;s so,&rsquo; Morris broke forth, &lsquo;how about the body? You don&rsquo;t
      mean to insinuate that thing I schemed and sweated for, and colported with
      my own hands, was the body of a total stranger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O no, we can&rsquo;t go as far as that,&rsquo; said Michael soothingly; &lsquo;you may have
      met him at the club.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris fell into a chair. &lsquo;I would have found it out if it had come to the
      house,&rsquo; he complained. &lsquo;And why didn&rsquo;t it? why did it go to Pitman? what
      right had Pitman to open it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you come to that, Morris, what have you done with the colossal
      Hercules?&rsquo; asked Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He went through it with the meat-axe,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all in spillikins
      in the back garden.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one thing,&rsquo; snapped Morris; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s my uncle again, my
      fraudulent trustee. He&rsquo;s mine, anyway. And the tontine too. I claim the
      tontine; I claim it now. I believe Uncle Masterman&rsquo;s dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must put a stop to this nonsense,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;and that for ever.
      You say too near the truth. In one sense your uncle is dead, and has been
      so long; but not in the sense of the tontine, which it is even on the
      cards he may yet live to win. Uncle Joseph saw him this morning; he will
      tell you he still lives, but his mind is in abeyance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did not know me,&rsquo; said Joseph; to do him justice, not without emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;re out again there, Morris,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;My eye! what a fool
      you&rsquo;ve made of yourself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And that was why you wouldn&rsquo;t compromise,&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for the absurd position in which you and Uncle Joseph have been making
      yourselves an exhibition,&rsquo; resumed Michael, &lsquo;it is more than time it came
      to an end. I have prepared a proper discharge in full, which you shall
      sign as a preliminary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Morris, &lsquo;and lose my seven thousand eight hundred pounds,
      and the leather business, and the contingent interest, and get nothing?
      Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like you to feel gratitude, Morris,&rsquo; began Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O, I know it&rsquo;s no good appealing to you, you sneering devil!&rsquo; cried
      Morris. &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s a stranger present, I can&rsquo;t think why, and I appeal
      to him. I was robbed of that money when I was an orphan, a mere child, at
      a commercial academy. Since then, I&rsquo;ve never had a wish but to get back my
      own. You may hear a lot of stuff about me; and there&rsquo;s no doubt at times I
      have been ill-advised. But it&rsquo;s the pathos of my situation; that&rsquo;s what I
      want to show you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morris,&rsquo; interrupted Michael, &lsquo;I do wish you would let me add one point,
      for I think it will affect your judgement. It&rsquo;s pathetic too since that&rsquo;s
      your taste in literature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what is it?&rsquo; said Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only the name of one of the persons who&rsquo;s to witness your signature,
      Morris,&rsquo; replied Michael. &lsquo;His name&rsquo;s Moss, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. &lsquo;I might have been sure it was you!&rsquo; cried
      Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll sign, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?&rsquo; cried Morris. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re compounding a
      felony.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well, then, we won&rsquo;t compound it, Morris,&rsquo; returned Michael. &lsquo;See
      how little I understood the sterling integrity of your character! I
      thought you would prefer it so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here, Michael,&rsquo; said John, &lsquo;this is all very fine and large; but how
      about me? Morris is gone up, I see that; but I&rsquo;m not. And I was robbed,
      too, mind you; and just as much an orphan, and at the blessed same academy
      as himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Johnny,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better leave it to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m your man,&rsquo; said John. &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t deceive a poor orphan, I&rsquo;ll take
      my oath. Morris, you sign that document, or I&rsquo;ll start in and astonish
      your weak mind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden alacrity, Morris proffered his willingness. Clerks were
      brought in, the discharge was executed, and there was Joseph a free man
      once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Michael, &lsquo;hear what I propose to do. Here, John and
      Morris, is the leather business made over to the pair of you in
      partnership. I have valued it at the lowest possible figure, Pogram and
      Jarris&rsquo;s. And here is a cheque for the balance of your fortune. Now, you
      see, Morris, you start fresh from the commercial academy; and, as you said
      yourself the leather business was looking up, I suppose you&rsquo;ll probably
      marry before long. Here&rsquo;s your marriage present&mdash;from a Mr Moss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Morris bounded on his cheque with a crimsoned countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the performance,&rsquo; remarked John. &lsquo;It seems too good to
      be true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s simply a readjustment,&rsquo; Michael explained. &lsquo;I take up Uncle Joseph&rsquo;s
      liabilities; and if he gets the tontine, it&rsquo;s to be mine; if my father
      gets it, it&rsquo;s mine anyway, you see. So that I&rsquo;m rather advantageously
      placed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morris, my unconverted friend, you&rsquo;ve got left,&rsquo; was John&rsquo;s comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, Mr Forsyth,&rsquo; resumed Michael, turning to his silent guest, &lsquo;here
      are all the criminals before you, except Pitman. I really didn&rsquo;t like to
      interrupt his scholastic career; but you can have him arrested at the
      seminary&mdash;I know his hours. Here we are then; we&rsquo;re not pretty to
      look at: what do you propose to do with us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing in the world, Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; returned Gideon. &lsquo;I seem to
      understand that this gentleman&rsquo;&mdash;-indicating Morris&mdash;&lsquo;is the
      fons et origo of the trouble; and, from what I gather, he has already paid
      through the nose. And really, to be quite frank, I do not see who is to
      gain by any scandal; not me, at least. And besides, I have to thank you
      for that brief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael blushed. &lsquo;It was the least I could do to let you have some
      business,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing more. I don&rsquo;t want you to
      misjudge poor Pitman, who is the most harmless being upon earth. I wish
      you would dine with me tonight, and see the creature on his native heath&mdash;say
      at Verrey&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no engagement, Mr Finsbury,&rsquo; replied Gideon. &lsquo;I shall be
      delighted. But subject to your judgement, can we do nothing for the man in
      the cart? I have qualms of conscience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing but sympathize,&rsquo; said Michael.
    </p>
